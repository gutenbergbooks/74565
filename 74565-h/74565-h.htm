<p>In this foreword, I wish first of all to thank Captain
Achmed Abdullah, Gertrude Atherton, Edwina Stanton
Babcock, Barry Benefield, Thomas Beer, Katharine Holland
Brown, Maxwell Struthers Burt, Francis Buzzell,
Donn Byrne of Oriel, Charles Caldwell Dobie, Theodore
Dreiser, George Gilbert, Susan Glaspell, Armistead
C. Gordon, Fannie Hurst, Arthur Johnson, Fanny Kemble
Johnson, Burton Kline, Mary Lerner, Sinclair Lewis,
Jeannette Marks, Walter J. Muilenburg, Seumas O’Brien,
Vincent O’Sullivan, Albert DuVerney Pentz, Lawrence
Perry, Mary Brecht Pulver, Harrison Rhodes, Benjamin
Rosenblatt, Fleta Campbell Springer, and Julian Street.
Each of these authors very kindly gave data which no
one could have gleaned; and in so doing they have contributed
largely to the usefulness of this study.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I must add to this list a former student, Pearl Doles Bell,
who interviewed Mrs. Irvin Cobb and who read her notes to
my summer class of 1916. (The interview was published, subsequently,
in <i>The</i> [New York] <i>Sun</i>, October 1, 1916.) My assistant,
Miss Shirley V. Long, collaborated in the analysis of
Miss Hurst’s “Get Ready the Wreaths.”</p>

</div>

<p>Only the other day a student demanded, “Why can’t
I get an author to tell me every step in the development
of one of his stories?” Although, as I tried to
point out, such a thorough proceeding is neither desirable
nor easily possible,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> yet the essentially valuable part
of the author’s progress may be most illuminative, and
it is obtainable. As one of these writers has said, the
artist is not analytical beforehand and is not so, of necessity,
after completing his work. But even from those
who progress only, as they assert, by inspiration come
clear and helpful statements concerning their starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
points and developing processes. This generosity of
successful writers augurs well for the future of fiction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Poe seems to be the sole writer who has asserted that he
could call to mind the progressive steps of any of his compositions.</p>

</div>

<p>Charles Caldwell Dobie has said:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “Any man who has
made a success of his business or profession always
seems to consider it his duty to warn others off the field.
The advice of both failure and success appears to be embodied
in one and the same word, ‘Don’t!’ This is a
curious paradox, and I shall not attempt to explain it.
Perhaps it is because the roads to success or to failure
are hard to distinguish, the sign-posts at the parting of
the ways almost undecipherable. Yes, I think it must
be this realization of the nearness of defeat that makes
the successful one so anxious to dissuade others from
the struggle. And yet, after all, there is a bit of egotism
back of the kindly advice we offer, rather patronizingly,
to our friends.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> <i>The Silhouette</i>, February, 1917.</p>

</div>

<p>“I would be the last person to warn the ambitious
from literary endeavor, providing they would rather
write than do anything else in the world; providing, also,
they were equipped with three qualifications. Determination
is the first; a hide at once sensitive and impervious
ranks second; an hour—at least—a day to
devote to the pursuit of their purpose. I say <i>devote</i>
advisedly; the true lover is never niggardly.... If
added to these virtues, one has a quiet room and no
telephone, half the battle is won.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Ellen Glasgow writes behind locked doors; Gertrude Atherton
“rings down an iron curtain” between herself and the
world.</p>

</div>

<p>And, further, by way of emphasis on work and study,
hear Burton Kline: “As an editor I have a feeling that
some of the writers who should be railroad presidents
or bank directors are getting in the way of real writers
that I ought to be discovering. In the long run it is
probably better to have all the writing we can get. The
wider the net is spread, the greater the chance of something
precious in the haul. The teaching of writing,
even if it finds only a few real writers, helps to sharpen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
the critical taste of the others and whet their appetite
for better writing. And I believe that sharper appetite
and more discriminating taste is beginning to be felt....
In the creation of a literature, an audience is as
necessary as the performers themselves. And the more
critical the audience, the more likely we are to have
great performers. The opportunity invites and develops
them....”</p>

<p>Speaking from the critic’s and teacher’s point of view,
I not only believe that one can “learn to write”; I know,
because more than once I have watched growth and
tended effort from failure to success. Many would-be
writers drop by the way; the telephone to pleasure is
too insistent, or the creative process is not sufficiently
joyful. Some students, however, need only an encouraging
word and sympathetic criticism. Harriet Welles is
an example of this sort. Her stories have been running
in <i>Scribner’s</i> for some months; she worked only a
year in my class at Columbia before producing finished
narratives. Others must labor and exercise patience in
order to accomplish a few—perhaps one or two—worthy
specimens of the story-teller’s art. I refer, for
illustration, to another student, Elizabeth Stead Taber,
whose “Scar” attracted favorable comment and drew
from Mr. O’Brien high praise in his volume of 1917.
Others write prolifically, turning out story after story,
before attaining the highest publications and prices—but
not of necessity before attaining excellent construction
and style. Marjorie Lewis Prentiss comes to mind
as an earnest and careful writer of this sort, who is improving
as steadily as she writes and publishes regularly.
I need not refer to Frederick S. Greene—now in France—who
has become well known through his stories, and
who felt that he worked best under class criticism. He
studied as he wrote, and his published stories, with only
two exceptions as I recall, were produced, first, for the
class-room audience. Even those who succeed only
once, or who never succeed, have learned to evaluate
the content and the manner of the printed narrative, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
have added to the body of the intelligent fiction-public.</p>

<p>The <i>great artist</i>, let me add, hews his own way.
But—! Gutzon Borglum once said that in his opinion
there had lived only three great masters of art: Phidias,
Michel Angelo, and Auguste Rodin. If these are the
great names in sculpture and pictorial art, who are those
in the world of fiction writing?</p>

... I use the form “short-story” to indicate the
particular <i>genre</i> or type, to distinguish it from the story
that is merely short. I have laid down my definition in
“A Handbook on Story Writing,”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a volume which the
student of this book should have at hand. In the space
here allowed, there can be no discussion of terminology.
Mr. O’Brien has expressed himself as uninterested in
technical distinctions, a fact which argues for the greater
range of his choice. He has preferred the larger values,
and therefore no adverse comment is implied in my classing
a story in these collections as a novelette or another
as a story that is merely short.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> From the standpoint
of literature, an advantage lies in the more extended
field. And at best, opinions differ. I can only set down
my own reactions, backed by eight years of teaching and
a life-time interest in fiction.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Dodd Mead &amp; Company, 1917. Third Edition, 1918.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> In quoting, I have used “short story” or “short-story” as
written by the various authors. It will be seen that the forms
are usually interchangeable.</p>

</div>

<p>To the student, I would emphasize the fact that studying
these “Yearbook” stories, valuable as such study
may become, will not make of you a writer; but from
them, this little book, and the wealth of detail which
Mr. O’Brien has accumulated, you can apprehend the elements
of technique and learn, at the same time, what
is successful from an editorial point of view. For every
short-story writer must be both an artist and a man of
business. If his work is not published, it <i>is</i> not. Much
of it, early in the exercising stages, should die. But
at the last there must be evidence of labor and of genius.
Only one evidence is admissible: the product.</p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>

<p>While you are learning, then, do not try to publish.
“Do” your exercises, and practise much; master the
principles, and express yourself. When you have become
full-grown, put away childish things, and forget
that you ever heard of technique.</p>

<p>Read the story before taking up the exercises.</p>

<p>Consult the biographical data in the Yearbooks for
1916, 1917, and 1918.</p>

<p>Observe to what extent the various authors have reflected
the country or region in which they have lived.
What conclusions do you draw?</p>

<p>Many of the stories conform to the laws of the
“Greek Unities.” Name them.</p>

<p>The following list is composed of the stories which are
best for <i>structural</i> study.</p>

<p class="indented20">
- “A Simple Act of Piety”<br>
- “The Sacrificial Altar”<br>
- “The Water-Hole”<br>
+ “The Great Auk”<br>
- “Boys Will Be Boys”<br>
- “The Gay Old Dog”<br>
- “The Knight’s Move”<br>
- “In Maulmain Fever-Ward”<br>
+ “A Jury of Her Peers”<br>
+ “The Cat of the Cane-Brake”<br>
- “The Bunker Mouse”<br>
+ “T. B.”<br>
+ “‘Ice Water, Pl——!’”<br>
- “Get Ready the Wreaths”<br>
- “Mr. Eberdeen’s House”<br>
- “The Willow Walk”<br>
+ “‘A Certain Rich Man—’”<br>
- “The Path of Glory”<br>
+ “The Waiting Years”<br>
- “Solitaire”<br>
+ “The Yellow Cat”<br><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
- “Down on Their Knees”<br>
- “Ching, Ching, Chinaman”<br>
+ “The Bounty Jumper”<br>
+ “None So Blind”<br>
+ “Half-Past Ten.”<br>
</p>

<p>The plus signs are prefixed to the titles of stories
which present the action in a closely circumscribed time
and place. Study the stories to which the minus sign is
prefixed to see how the authors have managed an extended
period of time and place, or of either. On what
phase of the action has emphasis been placed? How
has each author achieved unity of effect? Notice the
definite plot stages in these narratives marked by excellence
of structure. Although the technique of every
writer may differ from that of every other, yet in his
story he will see to it, consciously or unconsciously, that
high points, “lights,” or climaxes occur. It is a far call
from the Roman <i>biga</i> to the modern automobile; but
wheels, body and motor attachment characterize each as
a vehicle. From Poe to the present, the short-story
vehicle has had, and will continue to have, certain type
features.</p>

<p>The titles should be studied for their attractiveness,
originality, suggestiveness and bearing on the story.</p>

<p>The title may be:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

<li>The name of the chief character—“Onnie,”
“Chautonville.”</li>

<li>An epithet applied to the chief character—“The
Great Auk,” “The Bunker Mouse.”</li>

<li>A place—“Mr. Eberdeen’s House,” “The Water-Hole.”</li>

<li>A suggestion of—1. An objective theme or
idea—“The Excursion,” “The Wake.” 2. A
subjective theme or idea—“The Sacrificial Altar,”
“Boys will be Boys.”</li>

<li>An allusion expressed fully, in part, or conveyed
by implication—“Vengeance is Mine,” “The
Path of Glory.”</li>
</ol>



<p>One of the most difficult titles to create is that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
has a veiled suggestion, some bearing on the story that is
clear or significant only after the story has been read;
e.g., “Get Ready the Wreaths,” “The Interval.”</p>

<p>Group the stories according to dominant motives, observing
with what frequence certain universal motive-themes
occur. For example, the sacrifice motive is
found in the following: “The Sacrificial Altar,” “Onnie,”
“The Emperor of Elam,” “The Gay Old Dog,”
“The Knight’s Move,” “The Bunker Mouse,” “Making
Port,” “The Sun Chaser,” “Heart of Youth,” “A Certain
Rich Man,” “Zelig,” “The Menorah,” “The Bounty Jumper,”
“None So Blind.”</p>

<p>In each of the stories just named, what <i>feeling</i> or
power prompts the sacrifice? What is the sacrifice?
What is the effect of the sacrifice on the one making it?
On the one for whom it is made? On the reader? On
the final story-impression?</p>

<p>Study the following as the best examples of realism:
“The Excursion,” “Ma’s Pretties,” “Lonely Places,”
“The Silent Infare,” “The Big Stranger on Dorchester
Heights.” What difference, structurally, do you observe
between these narratives and those developed by the more
“romantic” writer?</p>

<p>In every story try to find indications of the author’s
theories about fiction or Art in general. For instance,
in “Feet of Gold”: “Naturally, since all of us are artists,
we seek the Truth through Beauty”; etc. (p. 309).</p>

<p>Characters may be described by the author. This, the
so-called “direct” method, is not in reality so direct or
vivid as the so-called “indirect” method. By the latter
a character reveals himself through act, speech, gesture;
he is also portrayed by what others say about him, and
by their reactions toward him.</p>

<p>What difference exists in spirit, mood and tempo between
the stories marked, respectively, by the direct and
the indirect methods?</p>

<p>By how many stories are you attracted at the beginning?
Does the drawing power lie in character, suggested
action, the picture of a setting, the mood or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
atmosphere, in some bit of philosophy, or other appeal?</p>

<p>Do any of the stories fall below expectation first
aroused? Why? How many fulfill the initial promise?</p>

<p>Which have the best endings? How many of these
seemed inevitable from an early stage of the action?
How many might have had diverse endings, altogether?
How many might have used different incidents for the
close, with the same general effect?</p>

<p>Which of the narratives seem to you most artistically
representative of life?</p>

<p>According to the localities represented by these
authors, try to arrive at the “short-story center” of the
United States.</p>

<p>In the following studies, try to enter constructively
into the processes indicated. Otherwise the exercises
will lose part of their value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea</span>: Captain Abdullah, an Asiatic, but
educated partly, and living altogether, in the Occident,
finds himself at times, he declares, in the position, less
emotional than intellectual and cultural, where he has to
make a choice between the ideals of East, or West of
Suez. In addition, his friends often ask him to explain
certain Oriental characteristics, motivations and viewpoints.</p>

<p>“Due either to a vital difference in the acceptance and
usage of basic standards, or to my personal inability of
expressing with the spoken word what I feel tersely to be
true, I have always been unable in these discussions to
express the one truth which I know; namely, that all this
talk about the Orient being romantic and mysterious and
rather high strung is asinine drivel, that indeed the shoe
hurts on the other foot, and that it is the West which is
romantic, both as to life and motivation of life, while the
East is as drab and grey and square as a question in abstract
dynamics.</p>

<p>“I make this claim chiefly in regard to the Chinese, who
are the Orientals <i>par excellence</i>. I consider them the
most logical, the most straight thinking, and by the same
token, the most civilized race on earth, not excepting the
Latins, the Hindus, the Arabs, or the Anglo-Saxons. I
believe them to be the only people who live up to the
sound dogma that two and two make four, and never
four and a quarter, or three and two thirds. I hold that
they are the easiest people in the world to understand,
that they carry their hearts on their sleeves, and that they
always mean exactly what they say, and say exactly what
they mean, in direct contrast to the Occidentals....</p>

<p>“The starting point of my tale, a whole series of
Chinatown tales, directly due to a conversation I had in
Chicago with Mr. Ray Long of the <i>Red Book</i>, who said
that since I seemed unable to interpret the Sons of the
Middle Kingdom with the spoken word I should try the
written word, was therefore the fundamental prosiness
and simplicity of the Oriental, the Chinaman, in contrast
to the complicated, suicidal emotionalism and maniacal
psychologizing of the Occidental—the latter characteristic
including a painful trick of dissecting emotions to
such a degree that they cease to be emotions. I know
China and the Chinese intimately, and am fairly familiar
with some of their dialects.</p>

<p>“From a primitive, Occidental viewpoint, murder and
a wife’s faithlessness seem to be the most important
things. From an as primitive Eastern viewpoint, the
same two things are the most negligible things. The
thing which matters most to the Oriental is honor and
piety, including their correct, codified outer observances.</p>

<p>“Thence my story.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Structurally perfect, the plot grows naturally
out of character.</p>

<p>The order of presentation begins with the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Nag Hong Fah kills Señora Garcia.</p>

<p><i>Circumstances antecedent</i> to the story action are
next presented.—1. Fanny’s marriage to Nag Hong
Fah indicated in “She was his wife,” etc. 2. Account
of Fanny. 3. Nag Hong Fah’s operations preceding
the proposal. (Note the introduction of a
second line of interest in the relations between Nag
Hong Fah and Yung Long, and Yung Quai.) 4.
The incident of the proposal. (Notice the clues:
Fanny claims a right to the streets, a pointer which
is augmented by the addition made, under her breath,
to her promise, “I’ll play square?”)</p>

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Through Nag Hong Fah’s invitation
to Yung Long, “Come! Have a drink!”
Fanny and Yung Long have opportunity to appraise
each other.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Dramatic Climax</i>: 1. Nag Hong
Fah pays cash to Yung Long, whom heretofore he
has paid on ninety days’ leeway. (What does this
signify as to the relations of the two Chinamen?)</p>

<p>2. Birth of Brian, Fanny’s son; the bestowal of
gifts upon Fanny by her Chinese husband.</p>

<p>3. The incident between Fanny and her friend
Mamie Ryan (to indicate that the Chink is playing
square, and therefore Fanny). Indications of Fanny’s
happiness.</p>

<p>4. Fanny is impressed by Yung Long but holds
to her “squareness.”</p>

<p>5. Nag Hong Fah acquires an option on an uptown
restaurant for his second son.</p>

<p>6. Little Fanny is born, bringing a “change into
the marital relations”; this time, no gifts are bestowed.</p>

<p>7. Nag tells Fanny he has given up the option.
This information on his part leads directly to the</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: First peak: the excellent scene
between Fanny and Nag Hong Fah, where the <i>racial
struggle</i> is best dramatized. Fanny’s imploring fails
against the stony wall of Nag Hong Fah’s determination.
All must be as he says; Little Fanny
will be disposed of as he sees fit. With Fanny the
greater wrong disappears in the lesser; she forgets
her daughter’s education in recalling that she had
received no presents at the child’s birth. “A bracelet....
That’s what I’m gonna get!” marks the
beginning of the resolution of the complication, which
has been so skilfully effected. The first peak of
the climax is succeeded by the second peak: Yung
Long in passing receives Fanny’s message, “Swell
looker!”</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Summary
repetitions of the dramatic climax scene emphasize
the winning out of Nag Hong Fah. 2. Nag Hong
Fah receives permission from the official head of
Fanny’s family to beat her. 3. She becomes the
submissive wife; the family seems a model
of happiness.</p>

<p>4. Fanny exhibits an “imitation” bracelet.</p>

<p>5. Her apparent adherence to “the straight and
narrow” is intensified by Brian’s report of the Finnish
sailor episode.</p>

<p>6. Fanny comes down with pneumonia. (Does
this seem logical or a too obvious device of the
author?)</p>

<p>7. Nag writes to Yung Quai and sends money for
her transportation to New York.</p>

<p>8. He indicates to the dying Fanny that he will
educate her daughter, and from the sale of Fanny’s
possessions—including the imitation bracelet.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i> in the first line of interest.—</p>

<p>Fanny, in a magnificent final flame of contempt and
victory, declares the worth of the bracelet, and that
Yung Long gave it to her. (Recall the allusion,
page 4, to this point as the “dramatic climax” for
Nag Hong Fah.)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dénouement</i>: The scene between
Nag Hong Fah and Yung Long, wherein Nag
conveys to Yung his knowledge of the gift, and
“motivates” the real cause of the gift. Yung affirms
Nag’s judgment, and further indicates that
Señora Garcia might best be put out of the way.
Nag Hong Fah agrees that it would be but a simple
act of piety and goes to get his knife. (Do they
here “mean what they say” or “say what they
mean”?)</p>

<p>The <i>struggle</i>, then, in the first line of interest (the
story of Fanny and Nag Hong Fah) is one between
the Occident and the Orient. The Occident wins,
in the person of Fanny. But because of the second
line of interest (the story of Nag Hong Fah,
Yung Long and Yung Quai), the victory gives way
to the victory of the Orient. Study the story
for the points of contact of these two lines, the
complication effected, and the unification of the two
interests.</p>

<p><i>Suspense</i>: Suspense sets in at the beginning,
when after the murder, the question arises, “Why
did he kill her?” This question is accompanied
by a desire to know more about the murderer.
The story if it fulfils the implied promise will explain.
Desire to know whether the murderer is
apprehended is satisfied after the next hundred words
or so, in the sentence, “For he is still at liberty.”
Herein, also, lies an element of novelty; the more
unoriginal story presents the crime, then arouses
suspense as to whether the criminal will be caught,
and justice meted out. (Study the story for further
working of the principle of suspense. What question
motivates your reading after Nag Hong Fah
beats Fanny, for example?)</p>

<p><i>Suggestion</i>: What is suggested to the reader in
Fanny’s becoming a model wife? In Miss Ritter’s
speech about “Real love”? In the “imitation”
bracelet? How much of the business “off-stage,”
after Fanny’s subsidence, is built up by the
reader?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The dominant character interest
lies in the racial features, which are set off by contrast
with each other. The author manifests skill in creating
hybrid Fanny, a product of racial crossing. In order of
importance, the main figures are: Nag Hong Fah,
Fanny, Yung Long, Quai Long.</p>

<p>Nag Hong Fah is played up as the chief character
through</p>

given to other characters. What is the greatest contributory
value of Señora Garcia? Of Edith Ritter?
Nag Sen Yet? The Chinese Soothsayer? Brian Neill?
Little Brian? Mamie Ryan? Little Fanny? Compare
the author’s ability to describe physical details with his
skill in revealing mental characteristics. To what extent
does the outer personality reveal the inner? Answer
for each of the important characters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Local Color.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. <i>Setting</i>: The locality is conveyed in the first
sentence. Where is it repeated, and how? What
contrasts do you find in the larger setting? What
details, for example, contribute to the Oriental characteristics?
Which to the American? Value of
the opium? of the schooner of beer? of the ivory
sticks? Why is the flat (page 5) described in
detail as to furnishings? (Give two reasons, from
two points of view.) What is the value of the contrast
between indications of wealth and of the neighborhood
features?</p>

<p>B. <i>Customs</i>: What customs testify to Captain
Abdullah’s intimate acquaintance with the Chinese?</p>

<p>C. <i>Speech</i>: Compare the Oriental matter, manner,
and meaning with the American matter, manner,
and meaning.</p>

<p>D. <i>Dress</i>: What bearing on character have the
accessories of dress? Yung Long’s bowler hat, his
loose sleeves and fan, Fanny’s furs, the earrings of
jade, and the bracelet—all serve what purpose?</p>

<p><i>Atmosphere</i>: Captain Abdullah says (page 4)
“the tale is of the Orient.” Note that he has secured
the Oriental <i>feel</i>, or atmosphere, modified
slightly by the American intrusion, through the harmonizing
of character, speech, dress, customs,—above
all, by emphasizing the things “which matter
most to the Oriental.” Contrast to similar Occidental
characteristics is subordinated to the intensification,
and is, therefore, contributory to the larger
impression.</p>
</div>

<p>As to the short-story, Captain Abdullah thinks that
length has nothing to do with it. “It can be seven hundred
words long, or seventy thousand. As to the latter
length, I consider Frank Swinnerton’s <i>Nocturne</i> a
short-story.” And he offers as a tentative definition this:
“The short-story is a story grouped logically about the
same character and characters, every bit of plot and action
working together to affect, influence, and make a
background for the same character and characters, eliminating,
in contrast to a novel, all side issues.”...</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea.</span> “It is so long since I wrote ‘The
Sacrificial Altar’ that I am rather hazy. My impression
is that I set out to draw a born artist hampered by certain
disabilities, and one of these being a disinclination for
life and utter absence of the love instinct, all the forces
of his nature concentrated upon his art, until they
reached the point of obsession. It was not until after
he had written the last book that he reacted to the normal
instincts he had inherited and which had been automatically
developed by the most normal bourgeoisie on
earth.”—<i>Gertrude Atherton.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analysis of Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: César Dupont persuades Louis
Bac to meet Berthe. (Note, even in the single incident,
the struggle—one of wills—and the argument
which wins the younger man.)</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Dramatic Climax</i>: 1. Louis meets
Berthe and “feels nothing.” 2. “—a daring idea
sprang ... darted into Louis’s relaxed brain.” 3.
Louis goes to the Dupont mansion, steals to the
girl’s room, sees her asleep. “He gazed resentfully
at that diminished beauty.... Why not give her
a fright?” He seizes a pillow and presses it against
her face. “She made a sudden downward movement,
gurgling. With a quick, cat-like leap he was
on her chest.”</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: His soul and passions are
liberated. “The body lay limp and flabby at last.”</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Climax of Action</i>: 1. Louis takes
pains to divert suspicion from himself. 2. In the
next three months he writes his book. (Note that
this is the climax of action in the <i>artist’s</i> struggle,
that the murder is the turning point after which he
succeeds artistically. But the climax of action for
the <i>man</i> is yet to come.) 3. At the end of the three
months, he hears that another has been hanged as
the murderer. 4. He confesses to M. Dupont. 5.
Dupont refuses to believe the story. 6. Louis writes
his confession.</p>

<p><i>The Climax of Action</i>: He walks to the Catholic
cemetery and shuts himself into the family vault.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Left to the reader. By a clue on
page 16 one would gather that Bac drank poison or
cut his wrists.</p>

<p>Study the development of this plot, as to scenes,
summaries, condensations, accelerations, gaps, and
omissions with reference to the artistic effect. For
example, the initial incident is presented dramatically,
the characters act it before the reader. The
steps to the dramatic climax are presented partly in
retrospect, from Louis’s point of view; those nearest
the climax are given dramatically.</p>

<p>Study the plot, also, with respect to the struggle.
What details are “for” Louis’s artistic success?
How are they related to those “against” his physical
being?</p>

<p>Is the plot, in connection with the development of
Louis’s character, probable? What logic has the
author employed to make it seem so? Mrs. Atherton’s
own testimony is valuable by way of reflecting
the artist’s temperament. As she herself says, although
she has never been impelled to murder and
has had always a consuming interest in life, yet until
the war, she never permitted anything to interfere
with her work.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> What value is there in Louis
Bac’s being French? Mrs. Atherton plays up Louis by
making him the spot-light figure and by presenting the
story from his angle. The invasion of his mind results,
incidentally, in the reader’s seeing the setting, situation,
and characters as he sees them.</p>

<p>Study the author’s description and exposition of Louis
Bac, then his speeches and his acts. What do the other
characters think of him? Observe how the various
methods of portraiture strengthen one another in the
finished portrait.</p>

<p>Berthe is lightly touched. The reader must “believe”
in her as a beautiful young girl, but must not give her
too great sympathy. Overmuch attention to her would
have detracted from the character unity of the narrative.</p>

<p>César Dupont is the contemporary representative of
the confidant, offering opportunity for dramatic form (in
the scene work) and consequent interest. Unity of
action and effect is conserved by making him Berthe’s
uncle; moreover, probability and verisimilitude are
gained by the relationship. Madame Dupont, M. Jules
Constant, Louis’s servants, and others, are the background
characters, carefully subdued so as not to interfere
with the chief action and consequent story unity.</p>

<p>Note every reference to San Francisco, then ask yourself
how strongly the setting works toward the securing
of the reader’s credulity. Try telling the story, mentally,
without allusion to locale. What is lost? “On a
pedestal was a vase that had belonged to Napoleon,
wired and fastened down,” etc. What is the value of
this sentence in the direction of capturing belief?
Study the management of the <i>time</i> element.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere.</span> Study the <i>feeling</i> of the story in connection
with the place. The first sentence of the narrative
strikes the tone “gray,” and gives the setting.
“Lone Mountain” conveys what impression? The
cemetery, used so powerfully in the climax of action,
deepens the gray note to its most somber hue. This
increased depth of tone works integratively with the
action to the powerful climax. Point out all the words
and phrases that intensify the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation of the Action.</span> The narrator is the
author who knows all, sees all, and exercises omniscience
over Louis’s mind.</p>

<p>Tell the plot without adhering to Louis’s point of view,
placing every event in the order of its occurrence. Note
the loss in suspense and cumulative effect.</p>

the principal character, the central idea, and the <i>mis-en-scène</i>.
I prefer to let the story work itself out. Else,
where would be the fun in it? Writing to me is an adventure,
and if I knew beforehand how it was to turn
out I should take no more interest in it than I should
take in the following year if I knew what was to happen
every day. Nevertheless, I would reject any finale that
I did not think logical. An arbitrary ending for the sake

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_EXCURSION">THE EXCURSION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea, or Starting-Point.</span> “The ‘Excursion’
was written from the humorous delight I have
always felt in excursions; it was started merely as
humorous description of certain inevitable excursion
types. I put the ‘story’ into already written appreciations
of sartorial and millinery triumphs as demonstrated
on any well-developed excursion.”—<i>Edwina Stanton
Babcock.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A study in realism, wherein the
general picture and all the excursionists are of quite as
much importance as the few predominant characters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Loosely interpreted, plot may be termed a
summing up of the “story,” a recapitulation. Technically,
the plot is the underlying plan “of which no part
can be removed without ruin to the whole”; it is the
development of the struggle or conflict which every
“short-story” possesses in common with the drama.</p>

<p>What in “The Excursion” is the struggle? What part
does the dialogue between the two sisters play in the
revelation of the struggle? If the struggle were made
dominant, what lamentable result would follow for the
“situation” value of the whole narrative? Is there a
hint near the conclusion that the struggle may have an
outcome? Is the plot finished, then, as the author has
left it? What is the embryonic dramatic climax or turning
point? (Find the moment when the feelings of
the passengers change toward Mrs. Tuttle.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> What types are represented in
Mrs. Tuttle? Mrs. Cronney? Mrs. Tinneray? Mr.
Tinneray? Mrs. Mealer? Mrs. Bean? The “lady in
a purple raincoat”? “A mild mannered youth with no
chin?” Miss Mealer? Hypatia Smith? Test the
economy and effectiveness of Miss Babcock’s portrayal
by asking yourself what further things these people
would do or say. Are the types such as would be found
in the same boat?</p>

<p>Compare the few figures of prominence with those
of the background. Are they in “high relief” or “low
relief”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere.</span> Realistic; it has the “feel” of the
typical American excursion. To achieve it, were necessary
the author’s keen observation, sane vision, and sense
of humor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accessory Details.</span> Enhancing and emphasizing the
reality of the occasion are the features, objects, and acts
associated with excursions. The crunch of peanuts, the
search for chewing gum, the squinting through ivory-headed
canes,—such details of the composition indicate
meticulous workmanship on the part of Miss Babcock.
Notice whether these features appeal rather to sight, to
hearing, or to other senses. What do you deduce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Methods of Miss Babcock.</span> “To me, in
writing, the story is keyed by a face, the note of a man’s
or a woman’s voice, a bit of lonely moorland, a scene
in a railway station, some little amusing bit some one
tells me. Then comes incubation for an absurdly uncertain
time. Then I dress up in a mass of what seems
to me related detail the significant centre, trying usually
to thrust in a few bits of humor for the simple reason
that life is made of it and the huge wonder is that the
whole world does not ‘grin like a dog and go about the
city.’... I love to paint things I’ve seen—particularly
natural things....”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CRUELTIES">CRUELTIES</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> Edwina Stanton Babcock says that
“Cruelties” was written around the figure of the spinster,
Frenzy, at whom she has had peeps for nearly eighteen
years. Her formal and carefully elaborate English,—her
garden, and her worries over it—all are drawn from
what Miss Babcock considers story material “for any
one.” Mrs. Tyarck and Mrs. Capron were painted in contrasts,
and “little Johnny Tyarck and what went on inside
of his wispy head at prayer meeting was put in because
of my own ceaseless wonder as to what goes on
inside the heads of the Johnny Tyarcks of this world.”</p>

<p>“Cruelties” took a long time to crystallize and it
seemed to me that the dénouement never really consummated.
I longed to have the wayward girl more of a person,
but the confines of the story would not allow it.
I wrote four drafts of it, cutting out quantities each
time.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Compared with “The Excursion,” this story
possesses a framework more substantial and of better
architecture. Though most readers will be interested in
the personality of the characters, rather than in the action,
nevertheless they will enjoy the steady and perceptible
progress to the solution of the slight complication.
This complication the author has effected through
the entangling of two interests. The first is the one-sided
struggle which arises between the women, Mrs.
Tyarck <i>et al</i>, and Miss Giddings—one-sided, inasmuch
as the former are active, while the latter is passive. It
is motivated by Frenzy’s attempt to rid her roses of
worms. (Is this motivation sufficient to account for the
animosity? What circumstance abets it? What value
has the fact that Mrs. Capron is a tract distributor?)
The second line of interest has to do with the young
girl’s downfall and rehabilitation. The fact that Miss
Giddings becomes her champion increases the petty animosity.
The outcome of the complication shows Frenzy
triumphant, in the scene between her and Mrs. Tyarck.</p>

<p>Are you satisfied with this dénouement? Why?</p>

<p>What motivation has Miss Babcock employed to explain
the girl’s taking refuge with Miss Giddings? Is it
adequate and convincing?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Two phases, each suggesting an
individual line of interest. 1. Scene in Frenzy’s
shop; the women see the girl pass. 2. Scene in
Frenzy’s garden, emphasizing the struggle between
Frenzy and insects. (What significance has the fact
that the ladies enter into relations with the fly-paper?
What symbolic part has the cherry tree?)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Mrs. Capron
prays the Lord to “keep us from needless cruelties.”
The author summarily indicates that Frenzy
becomes the butt of petty spite.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: First phase, as narrated, lies
in Miss Giddings’s metaphorical burial. Her enemies
are at the highest peak of their mean triumph. The
second phase, intensifying the first, indicates the
girl’s downfall. (Point out the forecast to this
dramatic climax.)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: 1. The incident
of the girl’s return. 2. Miss Frenzy keeps her,
as an assistant. 3. Mrs. Tyarck, in disapproval,
takes her patronage to the “other” store; Mrs.
Capron bestows tracts.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Frenzy turns the tables in
completely routing her enemy. (Scene between Mrs.
Tyarck and Frenzy.)</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Frenzy’s conjecture about the
cherry tree closes the story.</p>

<p>(What does the author lose in summarizing, rather
than in dramatizing, her dramatic climax? What
does she gain in relative values by its subdual?)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> By emphasizing physical traits
Miss Babcock has differentiated her characters unmistakably,
if a bit obviously. Frenzy’s stiffly refined diction
(in contrast to the slangy speech of coarse Mrs.
Tyarck), and Mrs. Capron’s hawking illustrate her
method. Tabulate the characteristics of the chief figures.</p>

<p>How has she individualized them by their acts? In
connection with your study of personal appearance, evaluate
the use: 1. Of the “two large pins of green ... like
bulbous, misplaced eyes”.... 2. Of the wing on Mrs.
Tyarck’s hat. 3. Of the girl’s red sweater.</p>

<p>The only masculine figures who appear on the stage
are little Johnnie Tyarck and Mr. Bloomby. Is the fact
that their male presence contributes to background, or
to realistic effect, a sufficient gain for shifting to their
respective points of view?</p>

<p>Which of the characters is most frequently found in
every day life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Local Color.</span> To what extent do the details of setting
(including customs, dialect, dress) typify any American
rural community? Can you justify the full paragraph
on the buttons?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time Element.</span> How has the author handled the
flight of months without seeming unduly to prolong the
action or to break the unity of effect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere.</span> Realistic, it reflects the mood of the
author who sees life as it is, rather than of the author
dominated by so-called “temperament.” She sees characters
and events, for the most part, through the kindly
glow of humor.</p>

<p>What double cause for smiling exists in the title of
the tract delivered in the first scene? Point out other
examples of humor.</p>

<p>“Usually in beginning a story,” Miss Babcock says,
“the first paragraph sets a sort of mechanism going in
me and controls the tone and atmosphere of the story.
Thus, you see, I almost <i>have</i> to begin with a paragraph
a little long. My great difficulty is my love of description
and painting of pictures—I despair of characters because
I know that one really never gets the whole character into
the story, any more than one gets it in life. I think the
writer must make the character act like its description. A
spit-curl character must have spit-curl ideas and behavior.
The more I write the more I am convinced that
the writer is a slave to two contradictory convictions;
that is, that he must give the truth of the story as he
has visioned it, and that there <i>is no</i> truth but that the
story-telling art has its very beginning in creating illusions.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ONNIE">ONNIE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> Onnie is a story of character; the
trait exploited leads to the tragic dénouement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea.</span> “The genesis of ‘Onnie’ was a desire
to record the dialect of one Patrick Qualey, a
gardener, now extinct. Patrick had preserved to the
age of seventy his Celtic fibre quite unimpaired. I think
he rather prided himself on the act, and, perhaps, embroidered
the garment of his speech a trifle. He died
very tamely of pneumonia, and Forest County, Pa., was
<i>not</i> his abiding place. As for Onnie, I confess that I
am weary of lovely Irishwomen, and a witty Irishwoman
I have never met....”—<i>Thomas Beer.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Read the story rapidly, and immediately
ask yourself, “What impression have I received
of Onnie, physically, mentally, and spiritually?”
Go over the story again, making note of every mention
of Onnie, and observe how forcefully, yet adroitly, the
author has emphasized details. What is the value of
having different characters observe her monstrousness
and her homeliness?</p>

<p>Notice that Onnie’s superstition makes her say, “The
gifts of children are the blessin’s of Mary’s self,” but
that her “odd scapular” has a sinister significance
throughout. Is this sinister suggestion in harmony with
the final sacrifice? Estimate the number of words in the
story, then the number emphasizing Onnie; finally, the
proportion devoted to the main incident and preparation
for it. What is the length of time over which Onnie’s
devotion to San extends? The length of the “story”
part of the narrative? If the proportion were reversed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
what would be the effect on the character work? On
the poignancy?</p>

<p>Name in order the other characters of the narrative,
and notice the proportion given to each. Study the ways
in which the author makes San a lovable youngster.
Take account of <a id="his"></a>his acts, his speeches, what his father
thinks of him, what the men do for his protection. In
the same way, take stock of the ways whereby Percival
is presented as a villain of the lowest type.</p>

<p>Are there too many characters in “Onnie” for best
short-story effect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Notice that the development of the struggle
lies in the latter half of the story. Define this struggle
for yourself. With whom do you immediately take
sides? Show how the main line of interest (Onnie’s

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Starting-Point.</span> Mr. Benefield states that it
has been so long since he wrote “Miss Willett” that
the processes of growth have gone out of his memory.
He is sure, however, that the story had its origin in a
show-window exhibit on a street in New York, where
a negro woman of a most evil expression used to
demonstrate a folding bed. “I probably noted the
exhibit in a book, left it for weeks or months and then
one day when I needed an idea I opened the note-book,
turned over the pages, stared at the scribbled note, and
the elements of the story as written floated to the center
of consciousness and joined in a more or less rough but
complete whole. After that it was merely a matter of
chiseling it into shape.”—<i>Barry Benefield.</i></p>

<p>The expression “floated to the center of consciousness”
seems to imply an inspirational writing force,
much as does Mrs. Pulver’s statement, “My crew will
come to me ready named, ready behavioured” (see page
169).</p>

<p>The striking relation between Mr. Benefield’s original
idea and his subsequently developed story is one of contrast.
It is noteworthy that <i>character</i> dominates in
each; incident is subordinate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Development.</span> The principle of suggestion, by
which this author has conveyed more than he could express,
works powerfully. Observe the first effect
created by the face of the sculptured Christ. “She
noticed that the long white dress of the infant,” etc.
(page 40). What are succeeding effects?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Action.</span> Miss Willett’s fortunes are in the
descendant at the beginning of the story. Where do
they take a turn? Is this dramatic climax motivated by
the influence of the face? (“Yesterday you had
nothin’; to-day you got everything.” This speech
clinches, for the reader who prefers the mystical interpretation,
the influence of the sculptured Jesus. To the
non-mystical reader, this logic alone is satisfactory: loss
of job had meant an unconscious spur, the spur of
desperation, with unanticipated success.) What is the
sequel to the day’s success which marks Miss Willett’s
continued interest in the face behind the green-slatted
window? State in order the steps leading to the discovery.
What is the climax of action? Does it constitute
a surprise for the reader as for Miss Willett?
What is the dénouement? With the dénouement, dawns
the realization of what underlying theme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Main Character.</span> According to the mystical
interpretation the chief character is the sculptured figure.
Otherwise, Miss Willett is the principal. According to
the two interpretations, the two become active and passive,
reciprocally.</p>

<p>What is the fundamental impression you receive of
Miss Willett’s physical person? What, to a writer, is
the advantage in choosing a very large or very small
person as a main character? Recall classic examples.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUSTER">BUSTER</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Opening Incident.</span> Emphasis falls at once on the
society which the hero disconcerts. The correctness of
living, the tranquil setting, provide the formal serenity
he is to break. “Lucien forgot himself completely,”
note the effect of the impeccable chauffeur’s exclamation
as testimony to the “demon boy.” The reader, startled
with the characters into attention, catches the epithet
up with interest and expectation.</p>

<p>Are the recounted escapades and the antecedent scene
necessary? or, in the wealth of instance which follows,
does the recountal seem extensive? Is the relaxation so
effected pleasant? Does the rehearsal of the antecedent
episode slow the tempo and hold the story back unnecessarily?
Besides revealing Buster, the material permits
the cousin’s mental distress to accumulate in effect and
allows time for the race to and from Boston.</p>

<p>Within the economy of the first picture, Buster’s manner,
the striking factor of his aspect, and his adolescent
growth are suggested. Notice that the following scene
enlarges the same points. Notice that in this scene and
the others between Buster and his aunts, Buster does the
talking. The aunts interpose, occasionally, protest and
reasoning. Do the scenes lack excitement other than
Buster’s excitement? There is not the vigorous clash of
speech with speech; for that, the characters are too well
mannered. If the struggle wants intensity, is there compensation
in the naturalness of the futile boyish tirading?
Buster seems to fume?</p>

<p>The trouble at the bakery serves to remind the reader
that Buster, in the apparent lull, is intent on his own
purposes. It serves, also, to divert the reader’s mind
from the preparation for the aeroplane incident.</p>

<p>The Bazaar at Dawn Towers: The personnel for this
scene is usual; there are the usual élite and the climber
from the West. (Notice the social status of Oklahoma
and Montana!) The futurist palace is a relieving detail.</p>

<p>The incident caps the social crimes of Buster; it provides
the climax for part one of the story, playing off
the vitality of the boy’s contention against the vanities
and half-sincerity of his Aunt’s set. Like Buster’s passionate
repetition, “I’ve got to know,” it is dramatic forecast.
Here is the significance of the story: youth struggling
with convention for its destiny.</p>

<p>The latter half of the story is fulfilment and realization.</p>

<p>Does the timing of this part—“and yesterday at dusk”—injure
the dramatic reality? The writer suggests this
is an account, a diary, a rehearsal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Episodic Plot.</span> The incidents of the plot do not
progress logically, as steps in action having a consequential
relation. But they are instances making the same
character point, having this unity. In the important
scenes the events are held in combination further by their
centralization about three characters: Dr. Lake, Miss
Edith, and Buster stand out at beginning, climax and
end.</p>

<p>Account for the animosity against Dr. Lake in the
boy’s tone and the story tone. Does the writer in her
characterization of him caricature the doctor? (the emphasis
on his eminence and his shirt-front in the opening
scenes, on his fright in the climax scene). Contrast his
appearance in the two parts of the story; his self-importance
in the earlier scenes with his eventual sacrifice.
The traditions reveal in the crisis their underlying sanction.
Does his geniality in the final scene convince?</p>

<p>Cousin Edith, if typical, is set apart from her environment
by a quality of humor and by her angle—as sympathetic
observer of Buster. Observe that Buster feels
the difference in her character. Is there a note of affectation
in her manner? Notice that, though she is influenced
by the aviator’s tirade, she is sufficiently herself
to remark his manners. Does Buster work in her
the magic of complete conviction? Is her wordy “gush”
when she first sees the unconscious boy natural in tone
and sentiment? She sees, remember, the “death-like”
face, at the sight of which “the limp, shivering doctor
pulled himself together with all his weary might.” Her
words “baby” the hero—does one “tuck” a brawny
fist under his cheek?</p>

<p>Buster is pictured most completely in his unconsciousness.
Do the stubborn chin there and the sulky under-lip
of the first scenes indicate an unpleasant willfulness?
Offset this impression by details in the summary of his
escapades which suggest a sympathetic kindness. Does
he show in the struggle with his Aunts a personal animosity?
Is the democracy revealed in the sailor episode
typical of his age? Compare Aunt Charlotte’s speech for
German methods with the Brigadier General’s on the
making of the hero. Do the aviator and the ambulance-driver
in their recognition of him reinforce qualities in
Buster which are representative?</p>

<p>“Concerning ‘Buster,’ he isn’t the portrait of any real
flesh-and-blood boy. But he tries to be the composite
portrait of the fourteen-year-olds that we all know, and
most of us own by ties of blood,—the tempestuous darling,
the pride and the despair of us. As for the story
itself, it is a well-meant but probably futile attempt to
convince the Average Parent,—to say nothing of the
average Aunt Charlotte and Cousin Edith,—that the
abysmal differences between the Busters of to-day and
their own generation are not so many conclusive proofs
that Buster and his tribe are essentially inferior. On
the contrary! For to my eyes, the rising generation is
a rising one, with a vengeance, and o’ertops its predecessors
with a disconcerting splendor. So the story tries
to make this conviction clear,—and very likely fails. For
one of my nearest and dearest was grieving only the other
day, because her own particular Buster insists that his
life’s ambition is to be a fire chief. ‘When we want him
to be a corporation lawyer, like his father!’... As to
definitions—could there be a compact definition of the
short-story? I doubt it. It’s a universal experience, put
into a duodecimo edition, but it’s a thousand other things,
besides.</p>

<p>“Some day, some one with authority will answer, I
hope, this question: Should the short-story writer be a
writer of short-stories and nothing more? Or—should
he write stories when and where he can, in the intervals of
other, far more absorbing, tasks?”—<i>Katharine Holland
Brown.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> The first sentence in “Fog” serves two
purposes. 1. It thrusts satirically at the commercializing
of the short story. 2. It induces the reader to
believe the inner narrative is a growth, not a construction.
The author seems to have hesitated between leaving
the supernatural story as one beautiful enough to
stand alone, and building about it the humorous and
even cynical external action. Or it may be that he saw
best to set off the fragile inner narrative with the hard
facts of a workaday world. Without the prelude to the
story (which begins with “He was born a thousand
miles from deep water”) and without the sentences after
the asterisks on page 73, the narrative recalls “The
Brushwood Boy.” And this is true, despite the rather
homely dialect. If, however, the reader is duly influenced
by the parts referred to, he cannot but recall
Thomas Bailey Aldrich’s “Struggle for Life,” as a
prototype.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Stages</i>: Andy pins up the ship; his father
blots it out; Andy is delirious; acquires name of
Wessel’s Andy.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Andy drifts
east; seeing a model of the <i>Lucky Star</i> in Stiles’s
place, he asks for a job; he gets it. He reveals
that he has had “a ship behind his eyes,”—a
schooner like the <i>Lucky Star</i>, and his knowledge
that he belongs on board. This knowledge is attended
by a fear: he does not know the cause for
which he must go. He indicates that something
holds him back from the sea, but refuses to disclose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
it. The immediate approach to the dramatic
climax is made in the story told, to the fisherman
from Gloucester, by old Jem Haskins. Andy learns
the facts about Dan and Hope Salisbury. Later,
he asks whether there is a picture of Hope in the
village.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Andy steals into Ed Salisbury’s
house and finds Hope’s picture.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Andy is
happy now (he knows why he must go aboard the
<i>Lucky Star</i>). He reveals the other vision which
has been, always, back of his eyes. Hope Salisbury
has the face of that vision. It is clear to him, now,
that in going aboard the vessel he will meet Hope.
He knows that the time is near. Immediately before
the climax of action, Stiles walks down the
beach. He sees a mist, blotting the blue water as
it comes. Turning homeward, he sees Andy, on
the edge of the beach, staring into the fog.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: As the surf closes over Andy,
Stiles gathers himself to jump. Then he sees the
<i>Lucky Star</i>, and Hope. Andy goes aboard....</p>
</div>

<p>Is the “inevitable” quality of the narrative increased
by making Andy “a queer one”? See
Georgie, by way of contrast, in “The Brushwood
Boy.”</p>

<p>Where does suspense first operate? Where do
you suspect, first, that Hope is meant to be Andy’s
bride?</p>

<p>Observe that Andy’s last act might have been
that of a deluded brain, and that Stiles’s vision of
the <i>Lucky Star</i> might have been one of hallucination.
The more imaginative reader will regard the ghost-ship
as objective, and will “believe” in the delayed
union of Hope and Andrew.</p>

<p>Read Richard Middleton’s “The Ghost Ship,” for
a frankly humorous treatment of theme. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
other stories in Mr. O’Brien’s collections have an
element of the supernatural?</p>

<p>Try presenting this story in pure English, from
the author’s point of view. Use the objective
method, abstaining from entrance into the mind of
any character. Take up the narrative at the point
of Andrew’s arrival at Stiles’s, and let his “queerness”
emerge through his acts and speeches.</p>

<p>How much creative work must you accomplish to
make a consistent character of Stiles? (Here,
Stiles, the narrator, must be studied through the
story he presents. In the dramatic presentation of
the story, he will become more objective.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Method.</span> The immediate story of the water-hole
is unfolded by the “rehearsed” method. What
gain results from telling in a city restaurant an experience
of the wilderness? Study the easy and natural way
in which Hardy’s story is brought forward. “You’ve
got a concrete instance back of that” (page 18) signifies
that the narrator will cite a case to prove his point. Recall
other stories told for similar purposes; <i>e.g.</i>, O.
Henry’s “The Theory and the Hound.”</p>

<p>Study the value of the two “I” narrators in the same
story, with respect to increasing verisimilitude and making
the reader “believe.” Kipling’s “The Courting of
Dinah Shadd,” for example, uses the same tactics.</p>

<p>Try re-telling the story by the dramatic method. Omit
the enveloping city setting; transfer Hardy from the first
to the third person, and keep the “spotlight” on him.
Begin with the arrival of Hardy at the home of the
Whitneys, and follow the course of events to their
dénouement. What do you lose in richness and effectiveness?
Do you gain anything in vividness or directness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Having studied preceding plot analyses, the
student will find small difficulty in settling upon the main
struggle in the action, the complicating line of interest,
and the climactic incident. The surprise ending, however,
calls for comment, in that to achieve it the author
used a natural and yet somewhat novel device. Hardy
has been speaking of himself, of course, in the first person.
When, therefore, he refers to the love that “one
of the young engineers” had for Mrs. Whitney we do
not suppose that he and the engineer were identical.
Hence, we receive the shock in the final paragraph:
“On the brown flesh of his forearm, I saw a queer,
ragged white cross—the scar a snake bite leaves when
it is cicatrized.” On reflection, one recognizes that
Whitney’s slight deception arose from motives of
delicacy, and is more than justifiable—it pleases, in
that it refines Hardy’s character. Deception as a means,
in general, to create surprise is common (See “The
Mastery of Surprise,” <i>Bookman</i>, October, 1917); but
it is given here a particularly excellent turn.</p>

<p>Observe, also, that the plot presents a variation of
the familiar “triangle.” The love story, however, is
buried beneath the greater theme; and therefore, although
it terminates in a lack of so-called poetic justice, yet its
combination with the main line of interest gives utmost
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> Mr. Burt has employed a favorite
artistic aid, contrast, in depicting Hardy and Whitney.
Does Hardy seem anywhere too modest or too egotistic
for the first person narrator? What value have the
friends who hear Hardy’s story in the full development
of Hardy as a character?</p>

value of a table scene to the writer who wishes to present
his story in the “rehearsed” manner? How does a
camp-fire compare with it? (Read, for example, Kipling’s
“The Courting of Dinah Shadd.”)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Introduction, with Emphasis on Characters.</span>
Why is so long an introductory paragraph given to
Burnaby?</p>

<p>Study the comment on guests and hostess, and observe
that the English financier must have an important part
in the ensuing action. “Sir John had inherited an
imagination.” Is this stated characteristic proved by
subsequent disclosures?</p>

<p>How is Burnaby’s entrance emphasized?</p>

<p>“She was interested by now” (page 48), an old device
and an excellent one for catching the reader’s attention.
The logic is this: “If that fascinating lady is interested,
there must be a reason.” Sir Conan Doyle employs
it often in the Sherlock Holmes stories, when
Sherlock asks for a repetition of a situation supposedly
just presented. It is thus put before the reader who
assumes that it must be worth hearing once, if Sherlock
will hear it twice.</p>

<p>What reason exists for Burnaby’s story as a predecessor
to Sir John’s? Does it motivate the telling of
Sir John’s? If so, does it also prejudice the reader in
favor of one or the other men? Does it incite curiosity
as to the squawman with a promise that curiosity will
be satisfied? Suppose that some other cause produced
Sir John’s story and the reader were left to surmise
what became of Bewsher. Would sympathy be with
Bewsher in an increased or diminished degree?</p>

<p>Why is Burnaby’s story briefer than Sir John’s?
Would it be possible to reverse the comparative lengths
with a new story-value? Try telling Bewsher’s story
as he might tell it to Burnaby at the time of the tea incident.</p>

<p>How is point given to the squaw man’s name? What
is the significance of the broken champagne glass?
Have literary artists often fallen back on a broken glass
by way of expressing emotion? Is it true to real life?
Does it <i>seem</i> true in fiction?</p>

<p>Is there sufficient suggestion that Bewsher’s story is
connected with that of Masters to justify initial interest
in Sir John’s narrative? (See the dénouement of
Burnaby’s.)</p>

<p>Where did you receive a hint that Masters is identifying
himself with Morton?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heart of the Whole Story: Masters’
Story.</span> Notice that Mr. Burt recognizes, as all artists
do, the various climaxes of the narrative. This is indicated
in what Sir John calls “high lights.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Initial Impulse</i> (<i>The “first high light”</i>):
Morton’s plan to cultivate the friendship of
Bewsher.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Dramatic Climax</i>: The importance
of himself comes home to Morton (“The second
high light”). “The third did not come until fifteen
years later” (Bewsher has been in India; Morton,
in a Banking House in London): Morton desires
a wife, luxury, and social standing. Bewsher turns
up; he and Morton fall in love with the same girl.
Bewsher leads, but he needs money. The “third
high light,” then, after fifteen years, is Bewsher’s
supplication. Morton makes him a rich man, but
does not promise to keep him so.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Bewsher forges a check, and
hands it to Morton in part payment of his indebtedness.
Morton subsequently shows the check to
the girl and then burns it before her eyes. He thus
wins her, not aware that her heart is broken.
Bewsher disappears.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: “The fourth high light”
Morton marries the girl.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: He suffers the realization that he
can never be a gentleman; he has learned that the
girl does not love him.</p>

<p>What statement of Sir John indicates a recognition
of the turning point in the rivalry between him
and Bewsher? Show that this outer or external
dramatic climax is the counterpart of the “third
high light.”</p>

<p><i>Dénouement of the Enveloping Narrative</i>: After
Sir John and his wife motor away, Burnaby explains
the relations between the real and the fictive
characters. What is the significance of his appellation,
“timber-wolf”?</p>

<p>What is the office of Mrs. Malcolm’s closing remark?</p>
</div>

<p>“We are told that all writing is a process of elision,
but no one seems to go further and say that short-story
writing is the process of ‘hitting the high spots’ plus the
art of making the intervals between the ‘high spots’
not only interesting but of such a quality that the ‘high
spots’ do not seem strained and unnatural. I find that
this is mostly done by the turn of a sentence, or by an
apparently adventitious aphorism, or a paragraph of
general comment.</p>

<p>“I do prefer the ‘I’ narrator greatly. 1st. It does
away with the ‘Smart Alec,’ omniscient atmosphere of
the third person, which seems to me the bane of most
American short-stories—the author gives an impression
of groping for his story, just as a person in real
life gropes when he narrates an incident. Conrad does
this, and does it so beautifully. It seems to me that a
‘thickness’ is achieved that can be got in no other way.
This, of course, does not apply to a novel, because in a
novel the ‘thickness’ is achieved by mere length.</p>

<p>“Secondly, as you say, it enables one to handle surprise
more readily.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, the story can be told in colloquial language,
and not in literary language, which makes it, so it seems
to me, more poignant. What experience I have had convinces
me that the poignancy of life is invariably expressed
by silences and by broken words. The French
know so well how to use dashes, for instance.</p>

<p>“Fourthly, and this is not paradoxical, despite the
colloquial language, one has a slight feeling of aloofness
from the characters or sees them through the medium of
a third person; and this, it seems to me, is the way one
sees things in real life....</p>

<p>“The story ordinarily comes to me as an incident or a
theme, sometimes as a character in a certain incident.
Then usually nothing happens for a long time. If I try
to think about it too much, so much the worse. In about
a month, I’ll think about it again and then, as a rule, it
begins to evolve. A great deal of the incident occurs to
me while I am actually writing.”—<i>Maxwell Struthers

obvious significance. This sketch about “Ma’s Pretties”
reflects in miniature the whole of an American community,
but in a manner which escapes him who seeks
and appreciates only surface values. It is the kind of
writing which acquires relative importance when placed
alongside examples which reflect other communities,
other nationalities.</p>

<p>The narrative is not a short-story, in the technical
sense. Mr. Buzzell feels this to be no adverse criticism,
since he says himself, “I am not particularly concerned
about the short-story as such. I am using a
short narrative form as a means of expression simply
because this form seems the most natural to me. There
are many things which I wish to record from my own
particular slant. It is to accomplish this, rather than to
produce short-stories, that I am writing. Naturally,
then, I am not particularly concerned with the technique
of the short-story, but on the other hand I am very
much concerned with the technique of effective writing
and have spent several years of hard work trying to
perfect my craftsmanship.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A realistic sketch, with emphasis on
the situation: Mrs. Brooks dies; her “pretties” are
divided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Characters.</span> What is the chief method of the
author for revealing character? How is the character
of the dead woman indicated? What can you say of the
dialogue by way of indicating feeling over (1) “Ma’s”
illness, (2) her death? Describe the daughters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Main Scene.</span> Is the story aptly entitled with
respect to the main incident? What universal theme is
struck in this well-developed scene between the girls in
“Ma’s” room?</p>

<p>“The things enumerated in ‘Ma’s Pretties’ as found
in her clothespress were part of the things my mother
found in my grandmother’s clothespress after the latter’s
death. I had to reject many items of course, and rearrange
those which I selected as typical. You may be
sure I spent a couple of weeks of hard work before I
was satisfied with this piece of writing.”—<i>Francis
Buzzell.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subordinate Scenes.</span> Which scene do you regard
as second in importance?</p>

<p>“The building up of the scene in which Ben Brooks
carries the earrings in to ‘Ma’ was also a bit of conscious
technique. I worked on that paragraph many
hours before I was satisfied with the names of the flowers
and had my tonal values right.”—<i>Francis Buzzell.</i></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Compare this story with Donn Byrne’s “The Wake.”
Apart from the narrative element, do you receive a decided
impression of national contrast?</p>

<p>Study the list of “pretties,” as you studied the list
of objects, etc., in Miss Babcock’s “The Excursion.”
Try to discover, here as there, their value in the reflection
of reality. Certain small objects connote what
larger objects? “Ma’s” switch, for example? Apply
this question to your consideration of each detail. Have
these apparently insignificant details a value similar to
that of synecdoche and metonymy?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LONELY_PLACES">LONELY PLACES</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> A technically well-wrought piece of realism,
both in its adherence to the point of view, and in
the rationalization of events. When it was first published,
it bore the (editorial) sub-title, “A Story of
Woman’s Inhumanity to Woman.” “I assure you,”
says Mr. Buzzell, “that woman’s inhumanity to woman
never entered my mind in writing this story. If readers
find a moral in any of my stories they can have it without
question; I didn’t put it there and I’ll lay no claim
to it.” What does this statement indicate with regard
to Mr. Buzzell’s ideas of art?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point, and Development.</span> “The beginning
of a poem, I assume from my own experience, is
a mood, a state of feeling, in the poet. He is stirred by
something and sets to work to express it. Well, then,
this is the way a story begins in me. As a result, the
first tangible thing I have is the atmosphere.... I remembered
that there were in Almont (Romeo) a number
of ‘grand’ houses, standing far back from the road, and
occupied by lonely women. I saw these houses buried
in trees in summer, smelled the wild honeysuckle,
watched the wrens flying in and out of the old teapots
hung in the vines of the dining-room porch. In the
winter I saw these houses buried in snow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Buzzell then wondered why these women had
never married and concluded that all the young men of
their generation had gone to the city to work.</p>

<p>“The next step was to select a definite setting. For
this I took an old house which I knew thoroughly—my
Grandfather’s house—the Orin Crisman house in
‘Addie Erb and her Girl Lottie.’ In this house I placed
a woman not quite forty years old and I named her
Abbie Snover. Then I gave her Old Chris as a companion.
I had reason for placing Old Chris in the house
with Abbie aside from an actual plot requirement. I
placed him there because I wanted to impress my reader
in the beginning with the loneliness of Abbie Snover’s
environment rather than with her utter lack of companionship.
The actual beginning of plot, I think, was
when I decided to take Old Chris away from her at the
end, so as to accentuate her loneliness. In searching for
a cause that would remove the old man I decided to
resort to gossip. The next question was how to start
the gossip. It seemed most natural to have the children
begin it. But how start the children? Abbie Snover
and Old Chris had lived alone in that big house for
fifteen years without any gossip; something would have
to happen to start it. So I decided that Abbie would
have to antagonize the children in some way. To be
able to antagonize the children would necessarily require
some kind of personal contact with them, so I had the
children form a habit of going to her door after cookies.
Then I invented the orange tree to give Abbie a reason
for driving them out of the house.</p>

<p>“The rest was simple until I sent Abbie out of the big
house on her journey to Mile Corners. It wasn’t until
I reached this point that I decided to let the reader
know that Old Chris was dead; that Abbie’s journey
through the snow was to be a fruitless one; that fate
had robbed her of her victory. If I had been concerned
with writing just a short story I would have given my
readers the desired surprise by withholding Old Chris’s
death from them until Abbie found it out. What I
wanted to do was to make them feel Abbie’s tragedy
every step of the way along that country road.”</p>

<p>The difference between the realist’s and the romanticist’s
methods may be seen by a consideration of what
a romanticist would have done at any stage of the
action. For example, Abbie’s kindness to the children
would have been the cause, not of her undoing, but
rather (under other circumstances) of her rehabilitation.
The business of the orange tree, again, might have
been used to turn the youngsters against her, as Mr.
Buzzell has used it, but in this event then the sender of
the orange tree would have arrived on the scene and
by his masterfulness properly subdued the gossip....
Again, the romanticist would have saved the surprise,
undoubtedly, for the reader as well as for Abbie. He
would have desired to create the shock, and leave reflection
to each reader.</p>

<p>Try telling the story from Mrs. Perry’s angle.</p>

<p>What is the struggle? Is it active or passive, or does
it pass from one to the other condition? Are the stages
of the plot well-marked, from initial impulse to climax
of action?</p>

<p>What is the atmosphere? What details of setting,
character, and action harmonize in the totality of effect?
What notes of contrast but serve to intensify the prevailing
mood?</p>

<p>Has the author attempted to enlist the reader’s
sympathy for Abbie? Is his work finer and truer, as a
result?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WAKE">THE WAKE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> “The Wake” suggests and pictures the
customs of the Irish following a death; at the same
time it tells a story. For this latter reason it is superior,
as a narrative, to “Supers,” which emphasizes the
picture, the condition. Emphasis is placed on the situation,
with a gradual heightening of interest as to a suggested
outcome. The young wife of an elderly husband
lies dead; she has loved and been loved by a younger
man; the younger man (Kennedy) has declared, “If
anything ever happens to that girl at your side, Michael
James, I’ll murder you!” And now as Michael sits in
dumb misery, he awaits the fulfillment of the threat.
The passive situation is merged into the dramatic
moment by the advent of Kennedy, who seeing the dead
woman, foregoes his intention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> The locale, according to Mr. Byrne, is
Ulster, North Ireland. What is the length of the action?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea.</span> “I wished to write a story of an
Irish wake which was neither utterly sordid, nor indelicately
funny.” Is the resultant mood, atmosphere,
in harmony with this intention?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Action.</span> Where is your interest first aroused?
At what point does the principle of suspense operate to
intensify interest? Is the dénouement satisfactory?
Is the action that of a “triangle” story? Compare it,
in this regard, with the action of “The Water-Hole.”
How is the love interest submerged in “The Wake”?
How is the hostility Kennedy bears James overcome?
What bearing on the action and on the theme has the
blind misery of James?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Characters.</span> From whose point of view is the
story presented? Who is the main character and why?
Is there in any way a suggestion that Death, as a
character, controls? Or is the influence of the dead
woman dominant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Theme.</span> In stating the theme, refer to the
germinal idea and comment on the author’s success.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Compare with this narrative, Chapter IX of Patrick
MacGill’s “The Rat-Pit.” Mr. MacGill’s setting is also
in Ulster: Donegal.</p>

<p>It should be added for the benefit of the student who
resents, or finds hampering, an insistence on short-story
type, that Mr. Donn Byrne believes there isn’t any such
thing as the short-story. “A story is a story whether
it’s a novel of 100,000 words or a short magazine affair.
There is no difference in technic between a 4,000 word
writing, like ‘The Wake’ and any of my big 15,000
worders—‘Sargasso Sea,’ for example, or ‘A Treasure
upon Earth.’ Get a worth while idea and make your
narrative interesting. That’s the only formula for any
piece of fiction. The short-story is to the novel what
the chip mashie shot is to the full St. Andrew Swing,
the same identical stroke used effectively for shorter
distance.”</p>

<p>Bring arguments to bear for or against Mr. Donn
Byrne’s statement. Be sure you have read widely before
drawing conclusions, and have studied the technique
of the stories and novels read.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_GREAT_AUK">THE GREAT AUK</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> The locale is New York City; the most
important scene, in the Scudder Theater. The time is
the present.</p>

<p>One of Irvin Cobb’s most remarkable powers is that of
picturing so vividly a setting that the reader cannot but
read and cannot but remember. What is the explanation
of this astonishing success? First of all, Mr. Cobb
is a keen observer. When he is out with his wife,
according to her he sees ten times more than she does,
yet she thinks she is seeing all there is to see. “When
he was writing ‘The County Trot’ Mrs. Cobb marveled
at his life-like pictures of the Kentucky characters, all
of whom he had really known. She asked him how it
was possible for him to remember their faces and
mannerisms after the lapse of so many years. He said:
‘Why, I can close my eyes and see the knotholes that
were in the fence around that fairground.’” This
quotation indicates a second requisite—accurate
memory. The third requisite is hard work, a condition
through which Mr. Cobb believes all success must come.
“When writing a story his object is to draw sharp pictures
that will never leave the reader. To do this, he
thinks out the minutest details of that picture, not that
he will use those details, but that he himself may really
see the picture as he writes.” The fact that he will not
“use all those details” which observation and memory
have supplied means that he has the ability to select.
And, finally, he knows how to handle an ample vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: The need for a “grandfather”
motivates the search of Verba and Offutt. (A
search, a type of “chase,” serves for a strong story-backbone.)</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Dramatic Climax</i>: 1. The cab-ride
to Bateman’s old haunts. 2. Finding the Scudder
theatre closed. 3. The visit to the wine-shop; the
clerk’s account of Bateman. 4. The ragged boy
volunteers information. 5. He leads them to the
side entrance of the theatre, into the gloom and
decay of which they make their way.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: The urchin whistles; the
curtain rolls up; old Bateman appears. The search
is now at an end. Bateman is found. The new
cause of suspense lies in curiosity over ensuing
events. To satisfy this curiosity, the author extends
the dramatic climax moment. The whole
scene at the theatre is a prolonged climax, gradually
revealing the old man’s unfitness, even as it soars
to a higher emotional climax. The story structure
may be roughly indicated by the diagram:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_illo_p45" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_illo_p45.png" alt="Story Structure Diagram">
</figure>

<p>That is, if M represents the dramatic climax
moment, then MS represents the dramatic climax
scene, which is the period of Bateman’s acting three
parts. With S, comes the realization that Bateman
is not in his “perfect mind.” Notice the
impeccable workmanship by which this recognition
is forced home to Verba in the last speech of Bateman,
the lines from “King Lear.” SZ is the brief
drop to the climax of action. See the story for
details.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: The two men leave Bateman
taking his curtain call.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Why are the insignificant actors
and actresses mentioned in the introduction? What is
the particular literary value of Grainger? What outstanding
characteristics has Bateman which none of the
others possess? What value has the title in connection
with the characters as a group?</p>

<p>How has Mr. Cobb individualized Verba and Offutt?
To which means of characterization is he most partial—author’s
description, the character’s own acts and
speeches, or what others think and say of him?</p>

<p>Of the urchin who piloted the searchers, what is the
first detail you recall? What other characters of Mr.
Cobb do you remember from some physical peculiarity
which he has emphasized?</p>

<p>Bateman is first presented to the reader through the
opinion of Verba. Next, he is shown through the wine-shop
clerk (who gives the effective clue as to Bateman’s
“dippiness”). Then, the ragged urchin volunteers his
contribution. What prepossessing characteristic does
the reader receive from him? Finally, the actor speaks
for himself. One part would be insufficient; it would
be “too easy”; therefore by the cumulative method Mr.
Cobb lets the old man show beyond a doubt that he is
not a type, but an actor. Dundreary, the Frenchman
and King Lear require varied ability.</p>

<p>Notice that what the character <i>does</i> is the climactic
portrayal—not what others say about him or what the
author might portray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Point out the clues to Bateman’s insanity.
Study Mr. Cobb’s figures of speech. He frequently
uses the human body as a basis for comparison (see,
for example, page 85: “Its stucco facings, shining
dimly like a row of teeth ...” and page 97: “the
mouth of the place was muzzled with iron, like an
Elizabethan shrew’s”). Why is such a basis conducive
to vividness for everybody?</p>

<p>What is the acting time of the story?</p>

<p>What is the significance of the contrast between the
modern play, as represented in the selections (pages 88
and 89), and the masterpieces suggested in the latter
part of the story.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Irvin Cobb never writes a story until he has worked it
over in his own mind for a couple of months. At the
same time, a hundred new ideas are developing; and as he
himself says he will not live long enough to write all his
stories. A year before he wrote “The Belled Buzzard”
he was visiting with Mrs. Cobb at her old home in
Georgia. They were sitting on a front porch one morning
when a huge buzzard flew past. Mr. Cobb recalled
a Southern story about a belled buzzard, and remarked
that he guessed he would weave a plot round it. Just
one year later, he finished the developing and wrote the
story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> A town in Kentucky, with emphasis on
Judge Priest’s office and the court-room. Time: in
recent years, not the immediate present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Judge Priest sends for Peep
O’Day and informs him that he has inherited eight
thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Dramatic Climax</i>: Peep takes a
silver dollar in advance from the Judge; he invests
it in fruit, cake, and candy. He invites the boys to
eat with him. The news of his fortune spreads,
and eventually reaches Percy Dwyer in the workhouse
at Evansville, Indiana (this is the hint at
an opposing force, the first suggestion of a struggle).
O’Day begins to “betray the vagaries of a disordered
intellect.” He buys a child’s wagon, soda-pop,
etc. With the youngsters he spends a day in
Bradshaw’s woods, playing games. The day and
his behavior are repeated.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: The apogee “came at the end
of two months.” It consists of three definite things:</p>

<p>
a. The arrival of the legacy,<br>
b. The arrival of the one-ring circus,<br>
c. The arrival of Nephew Dwyer.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Climax of Action</i>: Peep invests two
hundred dollars and takes the youngsters to the
circus. His nephew greets him at night; O’Day
bids him a quick good-bye. The nephew goes to
an attorney. Sublette addresses a petition to the
Circuit Judge setting forth that O’Day is of unsound
mind and that his nephew prays for the appointment
of a curator over the estate. Judge Priest
comes back from Reelfoot Lake. He talks with
O’Day, and says that he may tell on the witness
stand why he has spent the money as he has.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Pages 120-124. O’Day’s
speech. The climax of action is extended here, as
was the dramatic climax in “The Great Auk.”</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Judge Priest declares that the
Court is advised as to O’Day’s sanity; the youngsters
applaud; the elders join in the applause; O’Day is,
according to the Judge, “the sanest man in this entire
jurisdiction.” Court is adjourned. The Judge
lingers to make a suggestion to the sheriff.</p>

<p><i>Anti-Climax, and Close of the Narrative</i>: Peep
brings to Judge Priest a present of all-day suckers.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Judge Priest, who appears in
many of Mr. Cobb’s stories, is one of numerous types the
author knew when he was a Paducah reporter. The
student should study him as an example destined to
literary permanence. In the opinion of the present
critic he is the most representative figure in all the current
literature about the South. No Southerner can fail
to recognize the gentleman.</p>

<p>In this particular story how is the Judge described
by the author? How does his mail help to characterize
him? How does his behavior reveal him? For what
qualities do you like him at first? For what throughout?
(See especially pages 95, 117, 126.) For what,
finally?</p>

<p>Study the description of O’Day. Study page 94 for
the way Mr. Cobb makes O’Day appeal to the reader’s
sympathy. What in his past history has contributory
value to the present picture and present plot? What
in his environment? What do the townspeople think of
him? What exceptions are there? What is his attitude
to others? Study his behavior in connection with the
reception of news about his fortune, his subsequent acts,
and his speech in the court-room. Why is his story of
his early life of particular worth here? Note all the
reasons for which you sympathize with him. Wherein,
in brief, lies the human appeal of the story?</p>

<p>How are the minor characters hit off as individuals?
How are they repressed so as not to usurp too much of
the reader’s attention?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Study the easy way in which the locality is
kept before the reader. For example, the business about
the water-melons is essentially Southern.</p>

<p>From reading “The Great Auk” what would you
judge to have been one of Mr. Cobb’s chief interests?
What from reading “Boys Will Be Boys”?</p>

<p>Point out examples of this author’s humor.</p>

<p>What value has the fact (page 87) that the Court of
Appeals had affirmed a decision of the Judge?</p>

<p>What effects arise from the statement that Peep wore
a four dollar suit?</p>

<p>What forecast lies in O’Day’s admission of kinship to
Dwyer? (Page 91.)</p>

<p>How has the author handled suspense in the first incident—the
scene between the Judge and O’Day?
Where does he satisfy curiosity? Is this, then, a minor
climax of interest?</p>

<p>What reaction on the reader has O’Day’s statement,
“I can’t neither read nor write”?</p>

<p>Note on page 100 the first indication that Peep’s sanity
may be suspected (Speech of Mr. Quarles). This question
of his sanity joins Dwyer’s interest in securing the
money—a double force against Peep’s retaining his
fortune. Were you in doubt, on first reading, that
O’Day would remain in possession? Is the struggle well
developed as the essential foundation of the plot?</p>

<p>Is the dénouement satisfactory?</p>

</div>


<p>According to Mr. Dobie, “Laughter” was a work of
the imagination in every detail. It had nowhere a starting
point from reality, though—as he says—he now
and then draws a character from life, such as that of
Josef in “Four Saturdays,” and he occasionally shapes
an incident to the needs of the story, as he did in “The
Failure.” In “The Failure” and other stories, however,
as in “Where the Road Forked,” (<i>Harper’s</i>, June,
1917), he states that the incident was really a mere pivot
or peg on which he hung a cloak of almost pure imagination.</p>

<p>In regard to his maintaining his angle of narration so
perfectly, he says this phase of his craft is rather instinctive.
“Even before I became conscious of the force
of a single point of view I somehow managed to achieve
it without thinking about it at all.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The story being a psychological study of a man
who was untrue to himself and paid the penalty, one
might expect to find a lack of external incident. Here
the author accomplishes the difficult thing in that he has
developed an outer action, which thus objectively exploits
the mental processes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident.</i> (Anticipated by the cumulative
effect of the Italian’s playing.) Suvaroff visits his
next door neighbor to remonstrate against the accordion.
He learns that the Italian fears death at
the hands of Flavio Minetti, and he goes without
stating the object of his visit. (Notice that the
theme is struck in the Italian’s reason for fear: he
had <i>laughed</i> at Minetti.)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax</i>: Suvaroff betrays to
Minetti the whereabouts of the Italian. Before he
does so, Minetti warns him of the results of his so
doing, thus preparing for the next period of the
action. Minetti kills the Italian. Suvaroff sleeps.
He goes to breakfast; he hears a man has been
murdered. During the day he leaves the wine-shop
where he plays the violin (a significant outer
act reflecting his mental state). His mind wanders;
he thinks he dreamed last night. Arriving at his
rooms he finds the Italian’s mother. She divulges
that her son played to give pleasure to Suvaroff.
Minetti enters and bestows money on the old woman.
Suvaroff begs the hunchback, “Tell me in what
fashion do these people laugh at you?” (This is a
minor climax, one stage of the turning of Suvaroff’s
fortunes. But since he is not yet <i>able</i> to laugh, his
life is in no danger from Minetti. Had he not
laughed, he would have lived.) Minetti begs Suvaroff
to go away; but he declares that he cannot.
Suvaroff finds a squalid wine-shop where he sits
watching the shadows. He finds he may learn to
laugh at them, but not “at a man’s soul.” He buys
a pistol. Minetti says he will never use it. He tells
Minetti of the wine-shop pictures. While Suvaroff
sits studying the pictures a new one appears.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: He laughs, then turns and

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Suvaroff

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> San Francisco. “Fancy a novel about
Chicago or Buffalo, let us say, or Nashville, Tennessee!
There are just three big cities in the United States that
are ‘story cities’—New York, of course, New Orleans,
and, best of the lot, San Francisco.”—Frank Norris is
thus quoted by O. Henry at the beginning of “A Municipal
Report,” which (frequently proclaimed O. Henry’s
best story) has its setting in Nashville. How many of
the stories in this collection have their settings in New
York? in San Francisco? What other localities are represented?
What do you conclude?</p>

<p>How has Mr. Dobie kept setting before the reader?
Is it the same <i>city</i> as Mrs. Atherton uses in “The
Sacrificial Altar”? Has it the same <i>atmosphere</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Are Suvaroff and Minetti “living”
characters? Is Suvaroff, in the beginning, obsessed?
Does the obsession culminate in monomania?</p>

<p>Minetti’s physical self is given to the reader from
Suvaroff’s angle, which angle is consistently used
throughout. What is Suvaroff’s personal appearance?
How do you account for your answer? Whose mental
processes are <i>not</i> exploited? Why?</p>

<p>Why is the Italian’s mother introduced as a background
character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> The smaller features of the story reveal
also the hand of the craftsman: the use of night, the
wine-shop, ugliness, the shadows, and the arrangement
of the steps to what seems an inevitable ending.
“Seems”; for Mr. Dobie has a theory “that there is
no such thing as an inevitable ending. Any opening
situation may work out fifty ways.” Is it possible, after
certain steps in the action, to produce an ending other
than inevitable?</p>

<p>How is the cold inflexibility of Minetti made convincing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> “In my days of apprenticeship,” Mr.
Dobie says, “I planned my story out in detail and did
much re-writing. I think one must do this at the beginning.
But if one finally evolves an unconscious
technique which does away with a scenario I think it
makes for more spontaneous writing.... But it is
dangerous to advise methods. My point in dwelling on
the virtues of ‘planless stories’ is to encourage those
who find their salvation along these lines and who are
uncertain as to whether such a method will lead anywhere....
I started ‘Laughter’ in September, 1916,
wrote about five pages, got stuck, put it away, dug it
up three or four months later and in about three weeks
carried it to a conclusion....”</p>

<p>“It is rather hard to give a definition of a short story.
I should say briefly that a short story is the reaction of
a character or characters to a particular incident, circumstance
or crisis. Obviously, as its name implies, there
should be economy of line. Perhaps the shortest successful
story on record is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Three wise men of Gotham went to sea in a bowl.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If the bowl had been stronger, my tale had been longer.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“This narrative has also the virtue of suggestion: the
greater the suggestion, the greater the story. In other
words, a story is artistically successful in proportion to
the collaboration exacted from the reader.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: André Fernet meets the hunchback,
Flavio Minetti, and learns that he knows something
of Suvaroff’s death. He is brought under
Minetti’s power of fascination.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Dramatic Climax</i>: Fernet’s landlord,
Pollitto, speaks of his vacant room. Fernet resolves
to see Minetti again, and perhaps to learn
who killed Suvaroff. They meet at the Hotel de
France. Minetti says he was “expecting” Fernet.
Fernet goes with Minetti, in spite of warning, to a
wine-shop. Minetti’s suggestion that Fernet evidently
wished to know who murdered Suvaroff is
coupled with a warning that it is a “dreadful thing
to share such a secret.” But Fernet insists.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Minetti says, “It was I who
killed him,” whereupon Fernet laughs. Notice that
the dramatic climax, the laughter, falls early in this
story, whereas in the former it arrives tardily. Is
this logical, from the nature of the circumstances?</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Minetti
states that he kills every one who laughs at him.
He prepares a <i>café royal</i>; Fernet is afraid, but makes
a show of indifference or incredulity. In the morning,
Fernet learns that his landlord has rented the
room to Minetti; he thinks of going away but decides
to stay and “see what happens.” After some
days, Minetti calls on Fernet. He says he has tried
every slow way of murder except mental murder.
Fernet laughs, thus emphasizing the dramatic climax,
but as Minetti says it does not matter, “You can die
only once.” His speech intensifies the dramatic
forecast, already conveyed. Minetti supplies saccharine
for the coffee; Fernet fears “slow poison,”
but nevertheless drinks, as if in a spirit of bravado,
or unwillingness to seem afraid. Minetti harps on
the idea that Fernet has laughed at him. Fernet’s
landlord comments on his haggard appearance.
Fernet dreams. He stays away from his office,
visits the library, and asks for all the works on
poison. After dining alone, he meets Minetti, who
persuades him to have a cup of coffee. Fernet
speaks of his reading. He decides to go away to-morrow.
On arriving at his room, he feels sick
and is helped to bed by Minetti. He grows worse;
Minetti attends him, and sends for the doctor. Upon
the doctor’s prescribing delicacies, Minetti prepares
several which, in succession, Fernet refuses, and
which he sees are thrown out of the window. At
length he manages to tell the doctor that he is eating
nothing, in spite of Minetti’s assertion to the contrary.
The doctor thinks Fernet insane. At the
end of the week, even Minetti says he has eaten
nothing. Fernet resolves, again, to go away to-morrow.
But, still doing without food, he grows
weaker.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: He dies, but not before he
hears Minetti’s laughter and the words: “Without
any weapon save the mind!”</p>

<p>The <i>struggle</i> is well elaborated, as the preceding
plot outline indicates, even though it is the one-sided
bird-and-snake struggle, with a predetermined
outcome.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Compare Fernet with Suvaroff.
Which of the two offers the more difficult problem in
psychology? Is it easy to believe that Fernet submitted
to the sway of Minetti? Why, for example, did he not
go away?</p>

<p>Compare, also, the subordinate characters with those
in “Laughter.” What do most of them in this story
think or feel about Minetti? How does the author indicate
their attitudes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Is the angle of narration similar to that
in “Laughter”? What details appeal to the reader’s
gustatory sense? Study the symbolic use of the pepper-tree.
Compare it with the cherry-tree in “Cruelties.”

<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> The beginning of this story lay in
a bit about an insane man in Missouri, a story which
came to Mr. Dreiser quite ten years before he developed
it. The story quality testifies to the value of the long
dormant period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Study the narrative, observing with respect
to place that although you may feel you have your mind
on the exact locality, it presently flits to another probable
setting. This is because Mr. Dreiser attaches no importance
to the locality of his short stories, so long as
the incidents are American—and either urban or rural.
The gain is, of course, in favor of the essential nationality;
the loss is to the individual community. Does the
first grasp of setting bring with it the atmosphere of the
narrative?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A story of a search, at last successful.
It may be classed, also, as a story of the supernatural,
wherein the vision is one of a crazed brain. So
beautifully has the author handled the fancy and the
vision, however, that the reaction on the reader causes
wonder as to whether sanity and insanity are not relative,
or even interchangeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> By the omniscient author, who exercises
omniscience particularly over the mind of the main
character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> Henry Reifsneider, Phoebe Ann (his
wife), and background characters of the community
folk. These last exist to give verisimilitude, for contrast,
and as plot pivots. Cite an instance for each use.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Phoebe dies.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Henry
“sees” Phoebe until his mind gives way from
brooding. He is possessed of a fixed idea: Phoebe
left because he “reproached her for not leaving his
pipe where he was accustomed to find it.” He
searches for her (immediate first steps given in detail)
nearly seven years.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: He finds her.</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Immediate Climax of Action</i>: He

among the blooming apple trees.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: He is found, a smile upon his lips.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Study the presentation of Henry, which
gives so clear an impression of his unbalanced mind.
Study the motivation for this insanity, the author’s
analysis of Henry’s psychology, Henry’s acts, and his
speeches. What contributory effect has the <i>calling</i> for
Phoebe?</p>

<p>Would you agree that atmosphere is the dominant element
in the story? Is a supernatural story likely to be
one of atmosphere? Why?</p>

<p>Study the way in which the author has made vivid
the picture of the Reifsneider home. Observe the skill
with which he has contrasted the dull, even sordid, realism
of the actual setting with the beauty of Henry’s
visions. Why should the final one be the most beautiful?
What color words do you find? How does color,
or lack of it, aid in the unified effect?</p>

<p>This final division is almost, in itself, a short-story,
and with very little work on the author’s part might have

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> Miss Ferber recognizes the difficulties
of boxing into the shorter form the material which
would accommodate a larger space. “The tale of how
Jo Hertz came to be a loop-hound should not be compressed
within the limits of a short story. It should be
told as are the photoplays, with frequent throw-backs
and many cut-ins. To condense twenty-three years of
a man’s life into some five or six thousand words requires
a verbal economy amounting to parsimony” (page
209).</p>

<p>She has, however, achieved the short-story effect in
creating one dominant character,—in unifying the action,
and in conserving one purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proportion.</span> One of the greatest problems in developing
the action of a story which covers twenty-three
years is that of proportion. To hover over the “purple
patches,” to skip the unimportant stretches, and to link
them all up in a coherent organization—this requires
a sense of relative values. Why has the author developed
the little scene at the death of Jo’s mother?
Why, that is, did she not merely leave a statement of the
promise? Why is the rather full space (pages 210 ff.)
given to the sisters? How, even in characterizing them,
does the author keep Jo before the reader as the
prominent character? “Which brings us to one Sunday
in May” (page 213) indicates an episode of importance.
How much time has, supposedly, been passed over?
Why is this particular Sunday worked out in scene form?
Why are the stages of Jo’s and Emily’s love passed over
by leaps and bounds? Why is one brief paragraph,
only, given to the final disposition of Emily? Why is
greater length comparatively taken up in the disposal
of Eva and Babe and Carrie? How many years are
covered in pages 219 and 220? Why is a fair amount
of development placed on the gradual withdrawal of Eva
and Babe?</p>

<p>Roughly, fifteen pages are given to the narrative so far
(208-222), covering, say, twenty years. The remainder
of the story (pages 222-233) covers about three years,
or the period from the beginning of the war in 1914 to
the time when America’s first troops for France were
leaving. What is the logic of this proportion with reference
to the climax? to interest? to current events?</p>

<p>What does the scheme of the proportion, in short,
emphasize?</p>

“takes care of the girls” for a number of years. At
length, he falls in love with Emily. They wait
three years. The “girls” are still unmarried.
Emily and Jo part. Emily marries. (So passes the
first minor climax.) Eva marries. Babe (Estelle)
marries. Carrie takes a settlement job. Jo, free,
finds that he does not even think of matrimony.
The sisters fail to “marry him off.” He is gradually
left lonelier and lonelier. (The greatest depression
of Jo’s fortunes, financially, combines with
his loneliness to intensify his deserted bachelor
state.)</p>

financial or external condition comes about through
the War and the fact that leather goes up. Jo’s
fortune is made.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: The “gay
dog” business begins: Jo buys a car, he takes expensive
apartments, he tries to solace himself with
the friendship of a <i>demi-mondaine</i>. Eva sees him
buying a hat for the woman; Estelle crosses them in
a restaurant; Ethel, Eva’s daughter, meets him in her
company at the theatre. Eva and Estelle determine
to visit Jo and call a halt. They drive to his apartment.
Meantime Jo has been watching the boys
marching, has come across Emily, has helped her
to see her boy (Jo) march, and has told her good-by.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action, and Dénouement</i>: The climax
is dramatically worked out in the scene between the
sisters and Jo. They flee terrified at Jo’s counter-charges.

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Esmé attempts to fly to Brander,
dying. Motivation for the incident lies in Esmé’s
friendship for Brander.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Dramatic Climax</i>: Esmé is attacked
by a German plane; in the struggle the two planes
fall inside the German lines. Esmé is tortured. At
length, he consents to take up a photographer.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Esmé throws out the photographer.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Climax of Action</i>: He arrives inside
the lines of the allies. He tells his story to
Marston, his friend, who shocked at Esmé’s defection,
declares him a murderer. Esmé, in turn, is
appalled; he is unable to understand Marston’s different
code. Marston walks out of the tent.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Esmé returns to the German
lines, to “render a life for a life.”</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Marston finds Esmé’s note. In a
revulsion of feeling, he recognizes that he has failed
his friend.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The story is told by Marston to a
nurse, some time after the event. From Marston’s point
of view, therefore, the tale gains pathos, since his regret
is still as unceasing as unavailing. Further, the method
allows the reader a large share in constructing the story;
and, best of all, by changing the chronological order of
the events to the logical (they are also chronological as
far as Marston is concerned), the author gains suspense.
Reticence characterizes the handling of the uglier details,
which every reader will fill in for himself. The enveloping
action closes with the breaking of the wine-glass.
(Compare query, page 34.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The tragic failure of friendship,
in the struggle with conflicting ideals of honor, gives
the story its poignancy. It belongs in the group, therefore,
with “The Knight’s Move,” by Katherine Fullerton
Gerould, and “Greater Love—,” by Justus Miles
Forman. If the ideal of the mental man is typified by
his appearance and behavior, how well has Miss Freedley
succeeded in the creation of Esmé and Marston? To
what extent has she indicated the reaction in each after
crucial moments? How far has she subdued the outer
“I” narrator? If anticipated sympathy on her part
motivates Marston’s telling her the story, has the author
justified the hypothesis?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IMAGINATION">IMAGINATION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Comment.</span> In “Imagination” the author has directed
his skill toward revelation of character—a free
revelation produced by subtle provocation. A man has
reacted under a certain stimulus in a given way; under
recollection of the incident, twenty years later, he reacts in
a manner that intensifies and gives significance to his
earlier behavior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot</span>, then, is minified; situation is magnified. At
his club, Orrington, literary adviser, is dining with the
narrator and Reynolds, a popular writer. Orrington
relates an incident of the day, about a story and its
author: what might have been imagination proved to be
fact—the author of the story was hungry. Orrington
has found a job for him. The conflict, by virtue of which
the story interest develops, lies in the opposing views of
Orrington and Reynolds. The latter holds “It’s a very
great pity that young men without resources and settled
employment try to make their way by writing.” Orrington
then cites the case of twenty years ago. On the
very day that he, a young editor of a magazine on its
uppers, was offered a “peach” of a job, he read a
manuscript which seemed to indicate that the author
might be starving. He surrendered his chance of the
new position, recommending the author of the story.
He has never received a line of thanks; he has often
wondered how the man “got on.” Incidentally, as an
apparent by-product of his quixotism, his own stock began
to rise from that time. Reynolds states, at the close
of Orrington’s story, that he was the author who had
been given the “boost,” and that he had been too busy
writing the articles to send a note of thanks. He had
supposed that he was the recipient of a usual “tip.” He
declares, further, that he had not been in extremes, and
that his story was solely the product of imagination.
After he leaves the club, Orrington then reveals to the
narrator: “Of course I knew. Later, of course, much
later. The man who had hired him to do those articles
bragged about it to me,” etc.</p>

<p>The author has skilfully used the incident of the day
to force out the larger incident wherein Reynolds figures.
They are similar, and yet bear to one another a peculiar
contrasting relation. The young man of Orrington’s immediate
experience had written from facts; there is a
rather strong suggestion that he may amount to something.
Reynolds had written from imagination; the
whole characterization of his success, great as it seems,
indicates that it is an “output,” so much the worse for
literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> “You add to my pleasure by
bringing our friend”—what trait in Reynolds’ character
is announced in these first reported words? Follow the
trait throughout the story as it is expressed in his
speeches or acts; as it is suggested by the narrator, and
by Orrington.</p>

<p>“In motion he resembles a hippopotamus” ... “his
rather dull eyes” ... “his fat hand” ... “shrugged
his heavy shoulders” ... “as if he had been some fat
god of the Orient” ... “Orrington goggled”....
Study the portrait of Orrington pictured in these and
similar strokes by the narrator, and notice the evidences
of “contrast between his Falstaffian body and his nicely
discriminating mind.” What first ingratiates him with
the reader?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A “problem” story: the setting
forth in the guise of fiction of this question, “Shall a
man useful to society lay down his life for a social
member far inferior to himself?” The problem is
argued through the concrete instance, and by two
characters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Summary of the Instance.</span> When the <i>Argentina</i>
went down, Ferguson saved himself, rather than old
Bronson or the Neapolitan peasant women and children.
The world was the gainer by Ferguson’s survival.
Later, Ferguson loved and became engaged to a girl.
One day as they were out walking, they saw a bandy-legged,
sore-eyed youngster dash upon the railroad track
in front of a train. Ferguson could just have saved the
youngster at the cost of sacrificing himself, and although
he alone knew this, he allowed the girl to understand
that he had made a choice. She “rounded on him,” and
“spurned him in the grand manner.” Ferguson, loving
the girl, died. He probably committed suicide, not because
he had changed his own views, but because of
assuming the girl’s view to be correct. “He couldn’t
have admitted in words that she was right, when he
felt her so absolutely wrong; but he could make that
magnificent silent act of faith.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> Ferguson’s story is given by Havelock
to Chantry. Skill is evinced in so breaking the
rehearsed narrative as to allow discussion at proper
stages. The answers to the problem, supposed above,
are in opposition. Herein lies the basis of the discussion,
as of the struggle which Ferguson underwent.</p>

<p>Does the author in the presentation subtly convey her
own attitude on the question? What is it? How does
it emerge in her characterization of the men? In the
final sentence of the narrative?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IN_MAULMAIN_FEVER-WARD">IN MAULMAIN FEVER-WARD</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point and Fundamental Processes.</span>
“The starting point for ‘In Maulmain, Fever-Ward’ is
in the first four words of the tale: ‘Flood time on Salwin
River.’ Flood time! Then the flowers are rioting,
the traders are coming in and of course all things else
follow.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ve read Poe’s ‘Descent into the Maelstrom.’
Who has not? I do not believe that had anything
to do with my use of the whirlpool in the story.
The situation had been created; it was inevitable that
the agent of the priesthood of Siva, most subtle of all
in the whole world, would bring the two, or the girl,
into the folds of the python. But where? Surely, the
only place for this to happen was in the profundities of
the whirlpool, traditional abode of the mother of all
pythons of that whole region. Hence the necessity for
the flood itself to climax the action, to form the whirlpool
at its most tremendous phase, to take them down.
I wasn’t thinking of Poe when I sent them down into
the abyss. I went with them—and brought them out.</p>

<p>Did I know a person who had made a whirlpool
descent? Yes; myself. A fearless swimmer in youth,
I often dived under the swirls of falls and at the tails
of rapids, looking up to admire the way the whirls refract
light and to listen to the curious overtones the reverberations
of the water take on, and the singing of the gravel
as it churns ceaselessly.</p>

<p>... The superstitions—I call them the religious
phases of the tale—are taken from the real life of those
people. I could give you a map of the region, drawn to
scale. And there’s a temple in a certain Karen town,
and in that temple a god with a necklace of human heads,
or was, once in a way. (There never would be, however,
a snake, I think, in a chest in a temple of Siva.
Neither do they worship the snake, <i>per se</i>. They look
upon it as one of the agencies by which the Destroyer
works and will not even kill a snake that gets into a
house or bed.) When I say Karen town, there are
many, for the Karens are a race and have many towns.
Of course, I didn’t specify which one I meant in the
story. And I guess there isn’t such a whale-swallowing
whirlpool in that gorge, but I needed one right there
and what a fellow needs in fiction, he takes.”—<i>George
Gilbert.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> An excellent construction, the framework reveals
only one or two crudities to the eye of the critic.
The author has motivated every act, which is followed
by a logical effect; and in the presentation of the story, he
has chosen the order best calculated to win the reader’s
interest, curiosity, feeling of suspense, and finally of
satisfaction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: Pra Oom Bwhat invites the man
who calls himself Paul Brandon to visit the temples
of Karen. (Motivation: He hopes Brandon will
free Nagy N’Yang. Where, in the story, does the
reader learn this motivation?)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Minor Dramatic Climax</i>: Paul
loves Nagy N’Yang; she will prove to him why it
is folly. (Follows the capital temple scene.) It
is clear that she belongs to Siva. She leaves the
temple. Paul learns that she is married, but has
been claimed by the priests on her wedding day. He
makes known the conditions on which she will be
freed. The priest threatens: “I can call her back
or kill her”.... Paul crushes the cobra, thereby
drawing upon himself the curse of the priest.</p>

<p><i>Minor Dramatic Climax</i>: He takes Nagy N’Yang
away. In the first struggle, Paul has been successful,
but has unwittingly incurred the enmity of Pra
Oom Bwhat. This enmity motivates a deferred
major dramatic climax.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Major Dramatic Climax</i>: Nagy
N’Yang tattoos Paul’s head with the mark of Siva.
(What is her reason?) Pra Oom Bwhat arrives.
(How does the author apparently motivate his entry
upon the scene? At what point in the narrative
does his real motive become known?) Nagy N’Yang
is afraid. (Does the reader guess why?) The
rains come. Pra Oom Bwhat wears an air of mystery.
Ali Beg presents Paul with a throwing knife.
(Thrilling dramatic forecast.) The stream roars;
flood-tide approaches. (A fine harmony, in that
the dramatic climax approaches with it.) Pra Oom
Bwhat presents Nagy N’Yang with a gift. (What
is the effect on the reader, who is at the moment
ignorant of the real nature of the gift?) He asks
her to walk apart. Paul supposing he is Nagy
N’Yang’s “brother” permits them to go together.
The succeeding steps, not immediately presented,
are these: Pra Oom Bwhat binds Nagy N’Yang
to a teak log and leaves her to be swept down
the whirlpool. He returns to kill Paul, but in the
struggle, or</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i> (the real turning point), Paul
kills him with Ali Beg’s throwing knife. Before he
dies Pra Oom Bwhat lays the curse of Siva upon
Paul. This curse motivates, then, further steps in
the action.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Paul rushes
out to rescue Nagy N’Yang, but finds that the teak
log, bearing its dark burden, has swung farther out.
He notices the chest and momentarily hoping it may
be a boat lays hands on it. As he raises the lid, the
giant python glides out and disappears at the river
brink. (Here is an obvious manipulation, although
the average reader will lose sight of the management.
Is it likely that Paul would have tarried to
open the chest?) Paul then swims to the log and
crawls upon it just before it takes the whirlpool
plunge. In the bottom the python coils about the
trunk and Paul. As they emerge, Paul contrives
to kill the python with Ali Beg’s knife which he has
taken from the dead body of Pra Oom Bwhat, but
not before the snake has given him the glancing blow
on the brow, over the tattoo mark. Ali Beg finds
Paul and Nagy N’Yang, unconscious, and takes
them to the hospital. Paul tells the story, himself
learning from the nurse the detail just stated.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: He receives the scale from the
python and burns it over the night taper, so removing
the spell. He learns that Ali Beg and
Nagy N’Yang are with him, and says he and Nagy
will not go up-country again.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Narrator.</span> The first person is preferable; for
since Paul learns but tardily certain steps of the complication,
the reader (who knows only what Paul knows)
must remain in suspense. Try telling the story from
an objective point of view, placing every step in its
chronological order. What does the story lose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Compare the characteristics of
these Oriental figures with those in “A Simple Act of
Piety.” What have they in common? Why does Mr.
Gilbert choose a half-breed as his narrator and hero?
Point out every example of Paul’s fearlessness. Why
does he not appear conceited or egotistical, as the first
person narrator is in danger of seeming? What is
Pra Oom Bwhat’s distinguishing trait? Point out all
examples of his duplicity; of his religious or superstitious
nature.</p>

<p>Show that love, in one guise or another, largely motivates
every stage of the action, with certain exceptions,
which result from thwarted love. To what extent does
religion motivate the acts?</p>

<p>Is the python a “character”? What is Nagy N’Yang’s
chief rôle? Is Ali Beg’s part too obvious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Local Color.</span> Why and how does the author emphasize
the setting in the first paragraph? Where is the
snake <i>motif</i> introduced? Trace its progress, not only
for its plot value, but for its contribution to the reader’s
realization of setting. Where are the rains first mentioned?
What inanimate objects contribute to the local
color? What customs? What beliefs? Is the story
primarily one of setting, plot, or character; or have the
elements been harmonized into an evenly balanced narrative?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere.</span> Is the mood or “feel” of the story a
trifle too near melodrama? What phases of the action,
if any, would you subdue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> “Take away the medicine” (third paragraph).
Does this indication that a sick person is the
narrator surprise you? If so, is the technique sound?</p>

<p>Why are the details of Paul’s courtship left to the
reader?</p>

<p>Is the fight between Paul and Pra Oom Bwhat presented
economically? convincingly?</p>

<p>Good dramatic moments are found in such passages as
those wherein the noise in the chest is indicated <i>immediately</i>
after Paul says he would seek the way of love;
in the stirring <i>immediately</i> after Paul says, “I can kill
the snake”; in Paul’s crushing the cobra and so drawing
an immediate curse, etc. Point out several other examples.</p>

<p>Make a list of the struggles in order as they occurred.</p>

<p>What are the three main settings or scenes?</p>

<p>Does the happy dénouement convince you?</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Author’s Concept of the Term Short-story</span></p>

<p>“No mere relation of harmonized incidents, no recurrent
crises, can make a short story. There must be an
inner voice. To explain my meaning: I do not count
Chekhov’s ‘The Darling’ a short story.  It is a fine character
sketch.  It has a beginning, a very fine working out,
but it gets nowhere.  Three-fourths of the Russian short
stories, so-called, are not stories at all.  They are
sketches, narrations of incidents. They are like a song,
finely wrought, but with no dominant chord to resolve
them into a real end.”—<i>George Gilbert.</i></p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Title.</span> The intimate relation between the one-act
play and the short-story may be seen in the fact that the
narrative here told has its dramatic counterpart in the
stage production entitled “Trifles.” The latter was
presented in the season of 1916-1917 in New York City.
What is the excellence of each title?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea.</span> “A long time ago, when I was a
reporter in Iowa, I went to the house of a woman who
was being held for murder, and while the circumstances
were not at all those of ‘Trifles,’ it was out of that
experience the play grew.”—<i>Susan Glaspell.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Facts of the Plot.</span> Minnie Foster marries John
Wright. Basis for trouble lies in the fact that Minnie
is a lively girl, with a love for color and action, while
John is a hard man, and “like a raw wind that gets to the
bone.” They have no children, and as the years go by,
Minnie is more and more lonely. The neighbor women
leave her to herself; her isolation is pronounced. At
length, after many years, she comforts herself with a
caged bird. In a fit of rage, John wrings the bird’s neck.
Minnie, half-crazed, lays aside the body of the bird in
her sewing basket. Shortly after, while her husband is
asleep, she strangles him to death with a rope. The next
morning, she explains to a passing neighbor, who drops
in on a business visit, that John has been strangled by
“somebody”; that she is a sound sleeper, and sleeps on
the “inside” of the bed. The neighbor notifies the
sheriff. Minnie is taken to prison. The next day, the
sheriff, Peters, with his wife and the district attorney
go out to the Wright place to make an examination.
Hale, a neighbor, and Mrs. Hale are with them. The
men seek a cause, a motive, for the killing of Wright,
but find nothing. While they are making large and
futile observations, however, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters
discover the dead bird and other evidence. With
awakened understandings, the women conceal the evidence—Martha
Hale takes the bird away in her pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Management of the Facts—The Developed
Plot.</span> The most noteworthy and striking management
lies in corralling the whole story into one “cold March
morning,” and only part of that. Unity of setting, the
Wright home, is a less difficult achievement. Notice
that the story <i>introduction</i> calls up a setting outside the
Wright home, whereas the play (“Trifles”) used only
the kitchen at the Wrights’. Which is better for
intensification?</p>

<p>The chronological order of the plot is rearranged for
artistic purposes and for interest. The author begins
at the point of the visit to the empty house by the sheriff’s
party.</p>

<p>To understand thoroughly, the difference between the
order of plot presentation and the order of chronological
growth, make out a list of the details as you gather them
from the story progress. Then compare them with the
“Facts of the Plot,” set forth above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Story Presentation.</span> The narrative is given to the
reader according to the detective story method. Martha
Hale’s point of view is used at the start, after which
the dramatic method is employed, the spot-light shifting
from one woman to another, occasionally lighting on the
men, but lingering most often on Martha Hale. Why
is she the best one through whom the reader may understand
the entire situation?</p>

<p>Where do you first feel yourself responding to a sense
of mystery? How does the author convey this? What
is the effect in the first paragraph of these words?—“It
was no ordinary thing that called her away,” etc.</p>

<p>Observe the little apology (bottom of page 258) by
which the author has kept the search delayed until the
second day, after Minnie has been taken away. Why
is the latter accomplishment a plot necessity?</p>

<p>What contributory worth has the emphasis (page 259)
on Mrs. Hale’s Harry?... How is it used to effect
contrast?</p>

<p>Pages 260 and 261 in effect convey a rehearsal; but
they have dramatic worth also. Why? (Note that
Minnie’s speeches are quoted, not summarized.) See
following pages for similar dramatic accomplishment.</p>

<p>Study the natural way in which Hale and Peters are
pushed off the stage (page 263), leaving the women
together with the attorney. Purpose of his remaining a
moment?</p>

<p>Observe the care with which every important detail of
the plot is <i>motivated</i>.</p>

<p>Study the scene wherein the women, with an eye for
little things, arrive at the truth. Is their solution stated,
or is it suggested?</p>

<p>What do you deduce from the stove with the broken
lining? From the crazy stitches in the sewing? From
the bird-cage of the broken hinge?</p>

<p>What double meaning lies in the concluding sentence,
“We call it—knot it, Mr. Henderson”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Has the actual setting an influence on the
characters with respect to the story action? How is the
setting given in the finished narrative? How is it connected
with the theme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> Make a list of the characters and state
the reason for the existence of each with regard to the
action, to the verisimilitude, and to the need for contrast.
It is a difficult thing to focus clearly before the
reader a character who never “comes on the stage.”
Has Miss Glaspell succeeded in evoking for you the person
and the individuality of Minnie Wright?</p>

<p>Does one desire in a story of this nature <i>types</i> or <i>individuals</i>?
Which character should be most individual,
here, as regards the author’s purpose?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> “Most of my dialect stories have
some basis of fact in their incidents,” says Mr. Gordon,
“and in them I have sought to depict phases of the life
and characteristics of the negroes whom I grew up
among as a boy, and have known more or less intimately
since.</p>

<p>“‘The Silent Infare’ was a real occurrence, as was
the pillow episode in ‘Mr. Bolster’; and the story of
‘Sinjinn Surviving,’ in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, is in its main
features true. Nearly all, if not all, of the stories in the
‘Ommirandy’ book had some foundation of fact, and
the characters are amplified portraitures of ‘darkeys I
have known.’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> Not a short-story, in the limited
sense of the term, but an interesting reflection of life
in the story that is short. The action is not all directed
toward one end; the main episode is almost incidental
in the casualness of its occurrence—as incidents occur
in life;—character is the connecting link between the
earlier and the later stages of the narrative phases. Incidental
action contributes, rather to character than to
action; <i>e.g.</i>, the business of the guinea nest is a high
light on Ommirandy, on the boy, Tibe, and on the
mistress of the house, whereas it has only slight suggestive
value for the plot. Emphasis on the nest at the
close emphasizes the realistic qualities of the story.</p>

<p>The method of the author shows that he is “a born
story-teller.” He has an appreciation of the life about
him, he has the gift of literary expression, and he writes
perfect dialect. Interested in larger literary worth, he
can afford to disregard the technicalities of the short-story—which
may be, or may not be, a very well
executed piece of work and still fall short of permanent
excellence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Who is the main figure? What
pictures of herself do her own speeches contribute?
How does her attitude toward Mis’ Nancy emphasize
the portrait? Mis’ Nancy’s relations with her emphasize
what qualities? Does the author’s own comment help

noticed in your studying the portrayal of the various

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Studying the leisurely progress of the story,
should you pronounce it a growth or a construction?
Is there a struggle? Is the main incident presented in
its chronological order? How is it enhanced by being
given through the words of Ommirandy, rather than
from her point of view, as she looked through “de
winder over de kitchen do’,” but in the words of the

color story” by the dictum that it could have its action
nowhere except in the time and place indicated, would
you agree that this is a story of local color? What other
Virginian has used similar scenes? What stories akin
to this, in regard to the value of setting, do you find in
Mr. O’Brien’s collections?</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon once said in a letter to Rudyard Kipling,
so he states, that he regarded as the four best stories in
the English language, “Wandering Willie’s Tale” (In
“Redgauntlet”), Bret Harte’s “The Luck of Roaring
Camp,” George W. Cable’s “Posson Jone,” and Kipling’s
“The Man Who Was.” In which of the four is
the element of setting foremost?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Method.</span> “If I should venture to say anything
about the writing of a short story it would be this:
the first consideration is that the writer must have a short
story to tell; and the second consideration that, after
having learned by long and constant practice to write
clear and vigorous English, he must tell the story
naturally, after his own fashion. No one else’s fashion
will do.”</p>

<p>This explicit statement of Mr. Gordon should be considered
by every would-be writer of stories. Notice
that he does not say nothing can be learned from reading
other stories, or from studying their mechanism.
Would his own stories be what they are if a long line
of American writers had not preceded him? Would
Shakespeare have written his dramas if his immediate
predecessors and contemporaries had not lived? In another
age, when another literary <i>genre</i> was foremost,
Shakespeare would have foresworn drama for the prevailing
style.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CAT_OF_THE_CANE-BRAKE">THE CAT OF THE CANE-BRAKE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> Frederick Stuart Greene wrote this
story out of his experiences and observations as an engineer
in certain Southern districts. The pine woods,
the wretched cabin, the cane-brake, the rattlesnake, the
brogan shoes—these are concrete instances of his
familiarity with the setting. The immediate germinal
idea lies in an incident he recalled of seeing a severed
rattlesnake head fastened to the leg of a man in camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The compactly wrought plot is one of the best
in recent fiction. It is formed, in the main, from the
interweaving of two lines of interest. One has to do
with the struggle between the yellow cat and the woman,
Sally; the other spins out the sordid love affair between
Sally and the young engineer. The climax of action
shows a double defeat for the woman. The husband is
the connecting link, as he is the third figure in the triangle
story, and is the partisan of the cat in the other
line of interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: Sally throws the stick of wood
at the cat. Outward indication of latent animosity.</p>

<p><i>Steps in the Action</i>: Sally promises her lover to
meet him at midnight. She prepares the liquor-trap.
She hears of the big snake. She insists that
the cat be killed. Jim refuses. He orders her to
lay the mattress in the “dog-trot.” She sets the
liquor-trap. Jim, caught, drinks a toast to the cat.
Sally lies waiting for midnight.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: The cat finds the snake-head.
It passes the bed. Sally mutters and strikes out in
her sleep. The cat drops the snake-head.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Few, but
significant. Sally wakes, raises herself on her right
palm; her wrist meets the fangs of the rattler; in
agony she tries to wake Jim for help, but he lies
in a drunken stupor. Meantime, the young engineer
who has waited long, now sets out to reconnoitre.
He makes his way toward the cabin.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: In it is bound up the climax of
action which has, in part, already occurred in Sally’s
death. The engineer sees the dead woman, the
drunken man, and the purring cat. He flees.</p>

<p>Apart from the clever workmanship of the plot
construction, what examples of poetic justice do you
find?</p>

<p>Was it fate, chance, or tactics of hate which caused
the cat to drop the snake-head?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> In a story of plot prominence,
the characters need less individualization. Are these, in
your opinion, types or individuals? Which is the best
drawn? Which the least convincing? How does Sally,
early in the action, forfeit your sympathy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> How is Jim’s love for liquor (a hinge on
which the plot is made to turn) prepared for early in
the action?</p>

<p>How does the manner of the cat’s disposition of the
fish-head make logical its subsequent interest in the
snake-head?</p>

<p>What intensifying value has the “sad, gray moss”?</p>

<p>What effect has Sally’s second encounter with the cat?</p>

<p>Study the naturalness, the dramatic development, and
the enriching quality of the scene wherein the rattlesnake
is discussed. How does it make plausible, also,
the fact that the cat found the snake-head?</p>

<p>What contribution is made to the final effect in Jim’s
toast to the cat?</p>

<p>What do you think of the final sentence by way of conclusion?</p>

<p>What is the length of the action?</p>

<p>This story, the first Mr. Greene wrote, after taking
up the study of story technique, is particularly excellent
for showing early recognition of plot demands. If its
structure is, on investigation, a trifle obvious, it will be
all the better for the student’s purpose. On comparing
it with later stories by the same author, he will find that
growth which means ability to conceal mechanism—or
to forget it altogether.</p>

<p>The student needing exercise in plot construction
should read Captain Greene’s “Molly McGuire, Fourteen”
(<i>Century</i>, September, 1917; also reprinted in “A
Book of Short Stories,” edited by Blanche Colton
Williams), and should study his diagram of the lines of
interest and their complications (See “A Handbook on
Story Writing,” by Blanche Colton Williams, page 94).</p>

Mr. Greene’s profession—that of engineer; second, an
acquaintanceship with two Irishmen having characteristics
which suggested Larry and Dan; third, several

the narrative, on a voyage down the Eastern Coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Struggle</i>: This story is one of the best in
the collections for exemplifying the struggle element.
There are two main conflicts: that between
Dan and Larry, and the struggle between man’s wit
and power against the fury of the elements.</p>

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: What is the impulse that sets
the story in action?</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Mark the
principal stages toward the turning point in the
action. Is the struggle against the storm or the one
between Dan and Larry the prevailing interest?</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Observe the proximity of the
two turning points. Page 299, “the first hope
came ... there was a ‘feel’ ... that ribs and
beams and rivets were not so near the breaking-point.”
And page 300, “Larry had fallen!”
Show that each event is the dramatic climax, for
the individual lines, and that the close succession
means an increased dramatic effect for the whole
narrative.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Name the
important stages, observing that the author has
achieved a master-stroke in his moment of ease.
After the hardship of the struggle, comes the period
of rest. See page 305, “At five o’clock a Port Eads
pilot climbed over the side,” etc.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: The dénouement reveals a relationship
which may be, or not be, a surprise to the
reader. Does it matter whether the surprise exists?
To what conclusion does your answer point in regard
to the value of a “surprise ending”?</p>

<p>Is the dénouement satisfactory?</p>

<p>Did you learn from the clues in the first scene,
between Larry and Mary, more than the author intended?</p>

<p>Wherein do you find the preparation for the accident
which does for Larry? (See pages 289 and
290.)</p>

<p>What is the worth of the minor climax, page 295,
where the two struggles reach corresponding
points?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Make note of all the devices and
methods by which the author draws sympathy to Larry.
Show that the emotional reaction you experience arises
directly from the concept of his character and his acts.</p>

<p>What are the dominant traits of Dan? What is the
purpose of the scene wherein Dan knocks out the
stoker?</p>

<p>Originally, Mr. Greene called his character, Dan, by
the name of Mike. Why did he accept the advised
change?</p>

<p>Is the personality of Mary properly subdued? properly
elevated? In connection with your answer, notice
the value of having her introduced early in the action.</p>

<p>Who are the background characters? Do they usurp
too much of your interest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> What is the length of the action?</p>

<p>Is the business on pages 297 and 298 too technical
for a layman’s comprehension? If so, can one, nevertheless,
apprehend sufficiently to derive pleasure from the
recountal? To what effect do the various mechanical
appliances and parts contribute?</p>

<p>Study all the details by which Mr. Greene has conveyed
the <i>feeling</i> of the big storm. Where is the first
preparation for the fact that the incidents of this story
will be connected with the time of the Galveston Flood?</p>

<p>How did Larry receive the appellation of The Bunker
Mouse? Why is the episode told out of its chronological
place? Are any other important incidents presented out
of their time order?</p>

<p>From whose angle is the story told?</p>

<p>Intensifying worth of the sentence?—“So’s a trout;
but it’s got a damn poor show against a shark” (page
289).</p>

<p>Reason for this statement of the author?—“I wanted
to say that Dan purred like a tiger, but it was a jungle
figure, and of course I had to give it up.”</p>

<p>Point out instances of the author’s keeping the reader
aware of locality.</p>

<p>Show how the mood or feeling is harmonized with the
plot, which is itself one of complication wherein the
stages of the two main struggles are kept beautifully
parallel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> This seven or eight hundred word
short-story illustrates the extreme type. The setting is
the end of a pier; the time, only a few minutes; the
action represents a crisis in the life of one character,
the village drunkard; the struggle—which culminates
in the suicide of the drunkard—is between him and
society. The unities are, therefore, well conserved; the
singleness of effect is pronounced. It is a <i>tour de force</i>
in its manipulation of story elements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comment.</span> A capital example of a short-story built
on two lines of interest neatly joined. One line arises
from the desire of Old Tom to reach Liverpool; it illustrates
a passive struggle between wishing and waiting
on the one hand, and fate or chance on the other.
The second line arises from the situation of Spike’s
being in prison, a situation motivated or brought about
by the physical struggle between Spike and the bo’sun,
and is marked by Spike’s attempt to escape. The two
lines are connected by the fact that Tom has a queer
animosity for Spike, and that he is made the guardian
of Spike. Old Tom’s relation to his wife offers a
parallel to the relation between Spike and the mission
girl. Old Tom is unsuccessful, ironically so; Spike
escapes.</p>

<p>Is the motivation for Tom’s surrendering the keys of
Spike’s prison strong enough? What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Spike kills the bo’sun.</p>

<p><i>Steps to Dramatic Climax</i>: Spike is chained in
the locker. Tom is given the key. Tom is tempted
to give up the key. He refuses, hearing that the
ship will go on to Liverpool, knowing moreover
that if he betrays his duty his chance will be lost.
After four months the ship comes to anchor.
Meantime Spike has filed his chains. The girl
comes on board. She beseeches Old Tom to let him
go.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: “Take him.”</p>

<p><i>Steps to Climax of Action</i>: The escape in the
mission boat to the tramp steamer. Spike gets
aboard.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Tom must remain here. Irony in
the understanding that the tramp is bound for
Liverpool.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Rainbow Pete and the woman
are married.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Mushrat is
disappointed at Pete’s silence. He goes away,
after a time, to the North, “dreaming of gold.” The
woman, his wife, becomes head of Charlie’s establishment.
The town booms. Pal Yachy arrives.
He sings. Pete’s wife lured by the voice fears she
may be untrue to Pete if he does not hasten to return.
Pal Yachy offers a prize for the first child
born on Mushrat.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Pete returns. (See the scene
in the eating place.)</p>

the singer near his wife, with the gold prize. The
wife of Pete flings the gold clear of the bed. Pete
enters; throws out Pal Yachy, and the gold after

<p>Is there a resemblance in any way to the opera, “Pagliacci”?

whole story was worked out before morning. My own

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: In the first few months of the
war there comes to a small English village a refugee
from Alsace-Lorraine, a monument carver.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: He refuses
to go into shelter from the frequent air-raids and
learns from watching the planes that they pass a
certain point before turning toward London.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Acting upon his information
the gunners bring down a German plane.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: The carver
finds himself a hero. It is decided to erect a tombstone
over the dead aviator, with the inscription
“Here lies a fallen German.” The stone-cutter is
deputed to carve the inscription. The relics of the
raid are exposed for view in the little museum. The
personal effects of the aviator consist largely of a
young, fair-haired woman—“Meine Mutter.” The
stone-cutter goes out to buy a chisel and to visit the
museum. On his return he seems ill but goes to
work on the inscription.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: He dies before completing the
epitaph.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: The dead aviator was his son, as
the picture had revealed to him, and as the unfinished
inscription, “Bis patriæ m—,” revealed to the
Dean.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> Mr. Humphrey has seen fit to present
this tale as a rehearsed one. In so doing, he has secured
mellowness—consistent with utmost economy, sympathy
for the stone-cutter, and an excellent apology for the
Latin phrases. He evidently had in mind, whether at
the beginning or later, the resemblance between a fallen
aviator and the luckless Icarus. To emphasize the relation,
he needed to requisition classical atmosphere as well
as classical fact. This he has accomplished through the
stone-cutter’s interest in “Phœnix-Latin,” and the Oxford
Dean, who lectures on Latin poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The reserve of the refugee stone-cutter
is used to advantage in conserving economy and in
suggesting facts, rather than stating them, to the reader.
The Frenchman tells almost nothing of his past life, of
which much is nevertheless revealed through the illuminating
high lights of the action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> Fannie Hurst is represented in three collections
of “The Best Short Stories.” The reason lies
in the facts that she is one of the skilled technicians of
the time, one of the hardest workers—sparing no pains
to achieve that sound structure and perfection of detail
which only the seasoned artist knows how to achieve;
that by narrative, which stands without emphasis of didactic
or propaganda purpose, she yet manages to convey
an idea much larger than the story itself, and that she
has quite literally created a unique world of men and
women who nevertheless in their behavior reflect a part
of the myriad-minded and many-mooded contemporary
life. Any one of the present stories will prove the truth
of this assertion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point of “T. B.”</span> “The flint that struck
spark for ‘T. B.’,” says Miss Hurst, “was the sight of
a humpy looking girl standing before the window display
of a Tuberculosis exhibit.”</p>

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: Sara Juke faints at the Hibernian
Hop. How is this event prepared for in
the finally developed story?</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Sara and
Charley leave the hall. This stage is succeeded by
others preparing for the counter-play and emphasizing
the T. B. motif. They see the Tuberculosis
exhibit, and visit it. The pink-faced young attendant
gives Sara a circular. Sara fears the disease.
She revisits the display. The attendant, Eddie
Blaney, shows his interest, advising her to go to
a clinic for examination. At Sharkey’s Sara tells
Charley the doctor’s verdict. What obvious steps
in the action has the author omitted, thus giving the
reader the chance to help in constructing the story?</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Charley leaves Sara. (This
climax is, of course, intensified by its juxtaposition
to the doctor’s verdict; in fact, the two details together
may be regarded as a double climax. Miss
Hurst is one of the best authors to study for duplication
of dramatic climax effect. See also, for example,
“Ice Water.”)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Eddie
Blaney meets Sara and takes her to the country.
(Has this step been prepared for duly? Why is it
one not left to the reader’s imagination—that is,
the engagement made previously?) Eddie encourages
Sara, telling her she will be well by Christmas.</p>

author flash the personality of Sara? By which ones
in particular does she draw the reader’s sympathy to
her? How is Hattie Krakow used to emphasize the
appeal of Sara? What other purpose does Hattie serve?
How is her interest in Sara motivated? How far is
Charley one of a type? To what extent individualized?
Is the type or the individual more necessary to the author’s
purpose here? How does Charley’s treatment of
Sara enhance the reader’s interest? How is Blaney’s
solicitude for the girl motivated? Do the three characters
constitute the three figures of a “triangle” story?
If so, is the triangle one of distinctly new features?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> How many times does the scene change?

value? What is the time of the story?</p>

before gliding into the introduction of character and setting?
What is its worth? A student once asked Miss
Hurst why she chose such openings, suggesting that
quite frequently the reader found it difficult to see the
connection. Miss Hurst smilingly replied that it was
her idiosyncrasy. “That’s where I take <i>my</i> fling.” Is
there more back of her words than her modesty allowed

economical device. “On a morning when the

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> According to Miss Hurst, “Ice
Water, Pl—!” had its germinal beginnings in the self-imposed
query: Given, a mother whose joys are
largely the vicarious ones that come through her daughter,
to what extent can her own personal life become
more and more submerged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> The locale of this story is the same as that
of “T. B.” Point out evidence, explicit or implicit, of
its being New York City. In general, notice that the
larger setting of Miss Hurst’s stories is frequently St.
Louis or New York. Account for this fact. How long
is the action of “Ice Water, Pl—!”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The <i>initial impulse</i>, the force that sets the
story-action going, is Mr. Vetsburg’s invitation to Mrs.
Kaufman and Ruby to “come down to Atlantic City
over Easter.” (Fill in the important steps toward the
dramatic climax.) The <i>dramatic climax</i> is a double
header: First, Ruby accedes, after a struggle, to her
Mother’s wishes that she accept Mr. Vetsburg. Second,
Mrs. Kaufman gives in to Ruby’s marrying Leo.
By this clever duplication, not only is the turning point
made more emphatic, but the sympathy of the reader
is evoked for both mother and daughter. It is another
excellent instance of economy joined to strength.</p>

<p>The <i>climax of action</i> follows without much delay:
It is bound up with the dénouement, since in it Mrs.
Kaufman learns that it is herself—not her daughter—whom
Vetsburg loves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> What is Mrs. Kaufman’s outstanding
trait? Ruby’s? Vetsburg’s? Is Mrs. Kaufman’s
dominant characteristic logically connected with
her capability as a boarding-house keeper? Are the
two so portrayed as to make satisfactory the dénouement,
by which Mrs. Kaufman will be married to Mr.
Vetsburg? What preparation leads to the happy outcome?</p>

<p>How is Ruby akin to her sisters, Sara Juke and Selene
Coblenz? How is she differentiated? Is the individualization
stronger than the type resemblance?</p>

<p>Close your eyes after finishing the story and call up
images of the two main women characters and of Vetsburg.
Go over the narrative and see how the author has
given you these pictures, and also observe how accurately
you have registered the impressions. If there are discrepancies
between your memory and the presentation,
whose fault is it?</p>

<p>What purposes are fulfilled by the background figures?

<p>Who, in the first scene, reveals most of the situation to

<p>What is the purpose of the next fully developed scene
(in Mrs. Kaufman’s apartment)?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the continuation of the scene
(after Vetsy’s exit, page 194)? Does the division into
two parts (before and after the women retired) contribute
to more than an impression of reality?</p>

<p>Study the transition between the night scene and
eleven o’clock the next morning. What value has the
paragraph (page 205) beginning “At eleven”?</p>

<p>How does the author effect the return of Vetsburg
and Mrs. Kaufman to the apartment? How is Ruby
disposed of? (See page 107, “Down by Gimp’s I sent
her,” etc.).</p>

<p>Miss Hurst is an expert scene-developer. Her setting
is clear; her characters move as they move in real
life; the action is in the right tempo for the conditions
and the time at hand; no scene exists without a definite
purpose. It is the fine scene-work which gives to her
stories a dramatic quality equalled only by that of the
stage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GET_READY_THE_WREATHS">GET READY THE WREATHS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Germinal Idea.</span> “‘Get Ready the Wreaths’ was, of
course, inspired by the overwhelming drama of the Russian
Revolution and my own feeling that even Siberia
had at last been justified.”—<i>Fannie Hurst.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analysis.</span> The predominating interest and hence
line of action, since it composes a line of action, is
Mrs. Horowitz’s desire, struggle, to return to Russia.
This struggle has been going on for years; it has its roots
and beginnings in the past. Alone it would not make a
short-story; for the conflict is too level, too empty of
actual event.</p>

<p>The beginning of the complication is the engagement
of Selene Coblenz, her love affair constituting the second
line of interest. This is the truly complicating line,
although there is also a third line of interest, properly
subdued. It enters as a factor, first, in the first line.
Mark Haas shows his interest in Mrs. Coblenz by offering
to arrange for her the details of the Siberian journey.
For a long time this interest exists, seemingly, only as a
means for developing the main struggle: there is an entire
amalgamation of the two interests. (See e.g., page
342, “Mark Haas is going to fix it for me,” etc.).</p>

<p>Selene Coblenz’s request brings on the immediate
struggle. It is only a step, however, in Mrs. Horowitz’s
long fight to get back. It turns out to be not a deciding
step, but one in complication. See that by considering
the old lady’s struggle and the daughter’s mental anguish,
Shila’s search for ways and means starts from it, rather
than is decided by it. There is no specific struggle after
it, only a complication waiting to be solved. Mrs. Coblenz
could not have started for Russia until after the
reception, anyway. If Mrs. Horowitz had lived, she
could have gone. Nothing is determined by this minor
climax: much mental trouble starts from it for Shila.
It simply advances events to a state, where at a later
moment they will need a struggle and a decision.</p>

<p>But for another reason this decision of Mrs. Coblenz’s
is a big crisis, though not the big plot crisis; especially
is this true if you regard the story as a character story.
Shila’s devotion to her mother: her devotion to her
daughter—which will win? Will her sense of duty
triumph over her indulgence? The girl’s reasoning, the
impracticability of her mother’s desire assist to “play
up” the struggle. Selene is dominant with Shila. She
is a great-hearted woman, but she has a weakness. If
she had not had, Selene might have been a less self-centred
girl.</p>

<p>With the news of the reception evening, the three
lines of interest come together; the high point of the
complication is reached. There is a momentary crisis
for Mrs. Coblenz. Her mother can go back to Russia
now; she will insist. Selene’s line enters as an accomplished
fact to prevent: It helps with the other to compose
a crisis here. The third line is present as a factor
to assist: But Mrs. Coblenz is blind to it: it is a suspended
resource.</p>

<p>If, as you might have expected, the writer had derived
her solution from that line, she would have done
the obvious thing. Also she would have made Shila’s
escape from her weakness, easy. And, last of all, she
would have finished a struggle which had its derivation
in blood and sacrifice with a conclusion too quiet and
unheroic.</p>

<p>The author did what technically might have been a
very bad thing. To get your solution out of a physical
or natural stroke, by sudden illness or an accident of
nature, is equivalent to using a god from the machine,—a
charge often laid at the feet of Euripides. But
here the death is so logical a consequence—so well prepared
for—that you cannot quarrel with it. And there
is a heroic touch in having Mrs. Horowitz die beneath
her tremendous recollection and appreciation of all the
triumph had cost. The outcome is satisfying: she died
in a high moment. Shila is not too much to blame, and
consolation for her is at hand. And Selene, being right
from her angle of youth and life, is both happy and sufficiently
rebuked.</p>

<p>The story, then, has both an opposing and an assisting
line. The climax at which all meet and the forces balance
is the Revolution news. It is not the deciding moment
in the Selene story: that is over.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The emotional effect of this story represents in a high
degree one of the author’s best achievements. Her
stories are notable for their human appeal. One man
went so far as to state to the present critic that he would
willingly have bartered his soul to enable that old lady
to go back to Russia. Study all the ways by which she
reaches your sympathy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">General Methods.</span> “Almost invariably my plots
emerge from characters, rather than characters from
plots. I doubt if this latter is ever as sound in method
except in the detective or picaresque story.</p>

<p>“I have never based a short story upon a concrete incident,
written a character directly from ‘life,’ or, except
rarely, incorporated a speech actually heard into dialogue.</p>

<p>“A situation may suggest the beginnings of a story, or
a chance word be the seed of an idea, but most often I
find myself puttering around the hypothetical psychology
of folks....</p>

<p>“... Unity of Effect, no matter how the unities must
be smashed to attain it, I consider the corner stone of
short-story writing. Without it, architectural beauty
and continuity of development are impossible....”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_EBERDEENS_HOUSE">MR. EBERDEEN’S HOUSE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point and First Processes.</span> “Mr. Eberdeen’s
House” was to have been originally only the effect
of an old New England House upon a New Englander
who had become rather enfranchised from his austere beginnings,
and returned to find them only more crabbed,
more grim, than ever, and himself strangely, inexplicably
connected with them. The explanation of how he was
connected with this distasteful setting, and of why it
was distasteful to him evolved the author’s theme. The
hero’s great-grandmother had fled from the same grimness
and straight-lacedness and puritanism by running
away with a Frenchman, just before the birth of her
child, of whom Mr. Eberdeen was, contrary to his bleak,
orthodox suspicions, the father. The author’s plan was
to have Mr. Eberdeen, representing all that was distasteful
to the hero (Hastings) in the New England character,
the hero’s ancestor without his knowing it—the great-grandmother
after she had fled, having presumably taken
the name, for herself and child, of Tremaine.</p>

<p>The ghosts seemed to Mr. Johnson the only media
through which to tell the story pictorially. Whether
one believes ghosts in a story real or not is, in his opinion,
beside the point, so long as they <i>seem</i> real enough for the
sake of the telling. They may be compared to the <i>deus
ex machina</i> of Euripides, of to the scenes in motion pictures
which show what some one is dreaming or thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analysis of the Developed Story.</span> Some inner
stories may be detached from the outer husk as a letter
is drawn from its envelope (find examples in these collections).
Others are a necessary part of the external
interest and refuse to be separated without damage to
each. This story is one of the latter sort.</p>

<p>Jack Hastings and Julia Elliott are betrothed. He
has come to New England, after some time in Paris, to
make her a visit. It is understood, at the end of the
action, that they will go abroad to live. So much for the
outer wrappings which are bound so closely to the heart
of the matter, as is indicated in the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Preparation for the Significant Part, or the Inner
Story</i>: Jack’s mystic knowledge of “Mr. Eberdeen’s”
house; his strange mood; “they talked of it
bein’ ha’nted.” These details are followed by the
more immediate preparation; Jack is ill and sleepy,
he sleeps. (Or <i>does</i> he sleep?)</p>

<p>Here, then, the outer story merges, by way of
Jack as a medium, with the inner.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax of the Entire Story</i>: (Formed
by the developed scene which constitutes the inner
action.)</p>

<p><i>Explanation</i>: The characters are Jack Hastings,
his counterpart, and the woman. Jack in his dream
or vision apparently represents in his thoughts part
of the personality of his great-grandfather; the
ghostly counterpart represents that ancestor as he
really behaved, at what must have been the original
enactment of the scene. (Except, of course, that
Jack was absent from that drama, played long before
his birth.) This unique treatment of dual personality
should be studied with Markheim, William
Wilson, Jekyll and Hyde. For daring and yet naturalness
combined with mysticism, it surpasses them.
The end of the scene, in Jack’s vision, shows the
ancestor about to do violence to his wife (Jack’s
great-grandmother), but restrained by Jack himself.
(Interpreted, this is to say that the better nature of
Jack’s ancestor had actually triumphed and he had
rushed from his wife.)</p>

<p><i>The Climax of Action</i> (<i>Whole of the Story</i>):
Jack Hastings awakes to find that he has been ill.
He lies in a state of semi-realization, of semi-lapse
into the world of his recent adventure.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Julia and Hastings plan to live
abroad. The old man whom Jack had met appears
and suggests that he saw the lady of the house go
from it to meet Henry. (Is this old man a figment
of the fancy or is he real?) In this addition to
Jack’s vision is furnished the <i>dénouement</i> of the
inner story, Julia leads Jack to Mr. Eberdeen’s room,
which proves to be the one wherein he had seen the
ghostly drama. The original of “John” is the
portrait Julia had hung upon the panel. Julia reveals
that when Jack came downstairs he had looked
like the portrait. Clinching the reality of the whole
thing is the discovery of the gray chiffon, with
the bloodstains.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Comment.</span> This, then, is a narrative the mystery of
which must be explained by each reader to his own satisfaction.
If the reader “believes” in the supernatural,
he will take the whole thing, ghostly scene and all, as
somehow occurring. If he does not “believe,” he will
then accept the scene as the obsession of a sick man—with
a few details left in mystery. I should class it as
a story of the supernatural, wherein the appearance is
visible to the sick or the clairvoyant mind. Knowing
that the germinal idea had to do with the effect of a
house upon a man, and that the story is developed by
emphasis on this feeling, deepened by a ghostly visitation,
one would find it impossible to characterize the story as
other than one of atmosphere. And it is the best atmosphere
story in the four Yearbooks. The right way
to achieve an atmosphere story, Stevenson told us long
ago, is to begin with a mood induced by a place; Mr.
Johnson has pursued the plan.</p>

<p>Atmosphere is, then, bound up with setting; plot interest
follows in importance; character is of note mainly
in the unique manifestation of dual personality. A
dreamer, an artist, an idealist—any sensitive medium—would
fittingly play the part demanded. The love interest
enriches the action and humanizes the character.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_VISIT_OF_THE_MASTER">THE VISIT OF THE MASTER</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Comment.</span> Mr. Johnson has here produced a satirical
character study, wherein Mary Haviland Norton well
nigh stands in place of the story; but in playing up the
visit of Hurrell Oaks he has secured narrative interest.
That a mere visit should have loomed as an event, and
that the loss of it should have proved so disappointing
becomes the test of Miss Haviland’s character. Building
a story upon so negative an incident is a feat worthy of
Henry James—or Mary Haviland Norton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Miss Haviland invites Hurrell
Oaks to Newfair.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: It appears
that the great man can stop only for an hour or so.
To receive him worthily, Miss Haviland decorates
her apartment in borrowed and elegant trappings;
she invites a select few to meet him. George Norton,
who is devoted to Miss Haviland, is not included.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Hurrell Oaks arrives earlier
than he is expected, while Miss Haviland is in her
bath-tub, and since there is nobody to receive him
he goes away.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Miss Haviland
rushes out to detain him as the possibility occurs
to her that his knock may have heralded the famous
guest. He is gone. She betrays to one of her students
her bitter disappointment.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: As the guests arrive she tells
them that Hurrell Oaks could not wait, though he
and she have spent an “immemorial” hour together.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Two days afterward she announces
her engagement to George Norton.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The story is recounted ten years later,
after a formal dinner, by the student whom Miss Haviland
had helplessly, impulsively, taken into her half-confidence.
Her auditor is the narrator, presumably Mr. Johnson,
himself. The related story is exceptionally well told with
regard to the assumed narrator; she betrays just enough
of the school-girl character and manner to enliven the
drama of middle age. From a stylistic point of view, the
narrative testifies to the author’s craftmanship; for it is
almost as if told by a young woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Mary Haviland was interesting
to the girl narrator because of her native ability, determination,
and her acquired connoisseurship. Harmonizing
her fundamental power with her culture, hitting off
little discrepancies and exaggerations that the reader
might see her whole—these demanded a highly conscious
technique. Further, to regard her half-seriously, half-lightly,
yet in the end to demand the reader’s sympathy
and admiration for her, required nothing short of Meredithian
genius. Finally, the bubble of fun blown out at
the last: “She was no doubt <i>in the tub</i>,” etc., indicates
an irresponsible humor which makes play of the whole
situation.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Starting Point.</span> “I got the idea for ‘The
Strange-Looking Man,’” says Mrs. Costello, “from reading
of the homecoming of a Canadian soldier, limbless,
partially blind, wholly demented, to his young wife—Homebringing,
I should have said. As I read, I simply
<i>saw</i> the story as it was written, nor could I help feeling
as I wrote that my little boy symbolized Germany as she
is and my young man life, as we are now so strongly hoping
it may come to be.”</p>

<p>The statement from the author serves, also, to explain
her symbolical treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Should you judge, from the connotation,
that the time is the near or far future? What is the
place? How is it indicated?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action.</span> Brief; it begins “One morning,” page 363,
and ends with the final words, page 364. Do you foresee
the dénouement?</p>

<p>The narrative is remarkable in that it supposes a condition
the reverse, in many respects, of life in ante bellum
days. The <i>child</i> rocks his <i>father’s</i> cradle. He is
frightened by a whole man. The wrecks of men, in the
pictured setting, contrast sharply with the traveler, pages
363, 364.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Theme.</span> Like “The Strange-Looking Man,” this story
is pre-eminently one of idea. Written before the United
States declared war against Germany, it none the less is
of the Allied spirit. At the same time, it hints that Germany
has an ideal. (See page 151: “a vision which it
alone had understood.”) Would the same author probably
hold in 1919 his original concept? Does his dénouement
negate the ideal?</p>

<p>How is the “fear or desire” (page 145) bound up with
the dénouement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> What is the place of the dream? The time
<i>of</i> the dream? What outer occurrences emphasize it?
(See, notably, page 152, where the place of emphasis is
given to the “bold boom of the batteries.”) Give an
external and an internal proof of the fact that “Christmas
Eve, 1916” is the time <i>in</i> the dream.</p>

<p>How much of the prophecy (pages 147, 148) has
been fulfilled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Narrator.</span> In what branch of the service is
the narrator? Value of his point of view? Why does
he use the dream device? By what difficulties is the
dream method usually attended? How successful has
Mr. Jordan been in avoiding them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Action.</span> What is the chief incident of the inner
action? How does it emphasize the theme? What
relation has the outer action to that of the dreamed action?
Compare the technical device with that of “Mr.
Eberdeen’s House.” Wherein lies the power of the
dénouement? Why does the narrator say, “I thanked
God for the Germans”?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Starting Point.</span> Mr. Kline is not sure of his
beginnings; perhaps it came to him out of the ether “or
whatever it is that niggardly generates ideas.” “If it
had any starting point, perhaps it was in a talk I remember
once having with Braithwaite. I kicked because the
embattled farmers and others of New England never
seemed to fire a shot but some ready recorder was instantly
on hand to jot it down in a paean of praise;
while Pennsylvania, with pretty good history of its own,
too, and full of legend and lore, had gone totally unreported
by comparison. Maybe I started out to hunt
up its legends.”</p>

<p>After this pleasant admission, Mr. Kline confesses
that “The Caller in the Night” is no rendering of an
actual legend. “So far as I know there never was a
Screamer Moll, and no skeletons. The thunderstorm
probably happened. The rest is all made up.”</p>

<p>The statements are invaluable to one who sets out to
judge a piece of work with due regard to the author’s
purpose. His motive, in brief, is comparable to that of
Washington Irving. Father Knickerbocker is the “created
legendary” figure in which New York will take
pride forever.</p>

of her person is given (page 371) as “the tall and thin
but heavily framed figure of an old woman.” Is this
picture emphasized, for cumulative effect, or is it left
to stand alone? Are Moll’s first words well calculated,
as her initial speech? Why?</p>

<p>Through Screamer Moll’s story, the story of an insane
woman, Fannie and George appear striking in
certain details; dim in others. Is this both a necessary
fact, under the circumstances, and also better for the
author’s purpose? Describe Fannie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Mr. Kline used the rehearsed method of
telling the main story as an unconscious effort, no doubt,
to heighten the effect of legend, of “something by and
gone, all shadowy as recalled.”</p>

<p>Where, in the finished story, does the author first
sound his legend idea?</p>

<p>Why does he introduce the thunderstorm? Even if
Moll had not died, would it have had logical place in
the story? That is, would the repetition of the storm
scene cause a reaction from her crazed brain which would
impel her to speech? Does the duplication of the storm
(the one of the inner story echoed by the one of the
setting) increase the totality of effect?</p>

<p>Why is the place of emphasis (the end) given to the
finding of the two skeletons?</p>

<p>What are the chief sound effects? Are they in harmony
or contrast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Views of Mr. Kline.</span> He thinks Mr.
Braithwaite is right. “The only test of a short story
is, ‘Has the writer something interesting to say, and
does he say it in a manner to interest me?’” (See, by
way of comparison, Mr. Donn Byrne’s statement.) Mr.
Kline further believes that the great writers have never
had to thrash the air with “plot”—“from Hawthorne
and Poe and Bret Harte, from Balzac and Gautier and
Maupassant, from Tolstoy and Turgenev and Dostoievsky,
down to our own O. Henry.” According to his
statement and illustrations, how is he probably considering
the word plot? What difference is there between
plot invention and plot presentation? Does De Maupassant
show skill in arranging the plot <i>order</i> in “The
Necklace”? What would have happened to the story
had he not created the surprise? What would be the loss
in these stories of O. Henry had he not carefully constructed
his plot—“The Gift of the Magi,” “A Double-Dyed
Deceiver,” “The Furnished Room”?</p>

<p>Mr. Kline thinks that the only way to learn to write
is to write and keep writing, under wise and kindly
criticism of course. And he adds that if one can be
severe and honest enough one’s own criticism is best.
“To be a real writer, one must master himself, master
the world, and master his art.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse.</i> George Roberts, freight engineer,
drinker and fighter, on the way to ruin and discharge,
falls in love.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: He passes
every day the home of his sweetheart and toots his
whistle in a musical code fashion, “to let her know
he’s safe.” The whistle has a softening effect on a
crowd of woodsmen, engaged in restoring a Virginia
manor house and grounds. “The world seemed a
bit better for it.” The signal ceases. The cynics
say the engineer is probably drunk again. But one
of the men, Gordon, makes a special trip to the
village to find out.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: The engineer and the girl, he
learns, are married; they are away on their honeymoon.</p>

<p><i>Steps to the Climax of Action</i>: The signal is
resumed farther along the line, where the engineer
and his wife have set up a home of their own. For
three weeks the signal is faithful; then it ceases,
again, abruptly. After four days Gordon goes again
to the village. Just as he returns, the men hear the
signal fainter and farther away.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Gordon tells the men that the
wife is dead and is buried farther down the line; he
whistles “to let her know he’s safe.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> “It made a neat little story,” Mr.
Kline says of the engineer’s reclamation and present custom
of signaling. But without the supporting band of
workmen to throw it into relief it would hardly stand
alone. The group becomes, then, an integral part of the
1,500 word narrative which is given to the reader.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The girl, whose name is not even
mentioned, is the most potent character—or, perhaps,
love as expressed through her makes her, symbolically,
dominant. The engineer is the most important, by virtue
of his active rôle; the workmen are the background characters,
as they come under the influence of the simple
demonstration of affection; they are the foreground characters,
as the story is presented. What traits are manifest
in various individuals of the group? How do these
traits sharpen the dénouement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Why is Virginia chosen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> What contribution is made by the choice of
“Annie Laurie”? On what thought does the final bar
end? Did you, as you read, notice this sinister clue?

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LITTLE_SELVES">LITTLE SELVES</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point and Structural Processes.</span> “You
were right,” Miss Lerner says, “about my knowing ‘the
prototype of old Margaret.’ And every one of her
storied recollections is a real one, told for the most part
in her own words. She still insists so stoutly on the
reality of the ‘little old man with the high hat,’ the bewitched
churn, the fairies’ chairs and tables, that one
ends by believing in them, too. So you see the material
came ready to my hand. All I had to do was to
vivify it, and cast it in the most dramatic form possible.</p>

<p>“Old Margaret is not dead, however. She reads and
re-reads ‘Little Selves,’ and says she can smell the peat
fire and hear the kettle humming on the hob. It was an
old friend of hers who died—of cancer, as the story
ran; and Margaret used to spend many an hour talking
with her those last days. Their reminiscences, however,
were of the time of their young womanhood; they did not
meet in the old country.</p>

<p>“All this cherished material had long lain in my mind.
Its greatest appeal to me perhaps depended on the fact
that I, too, had always been an inveterate ponderer of
moments of my extreme childhood. Even at eight or
ten, I used to re-live isolated moments of particular interest
from my ‘past,’ which even then seemed bathed
in a ‘livelier light.’</p>

<p>“The final impulse came one day on hearing Stevenson’s
phrase, ‘Nothing matters much that happens to
a boy after he is seven.’ At once I saw the whole story.
Margaret must die, of course, and dying revisit the
scenes of her childhood. That bit of manipulation would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
heighten and intensify the whole tale. She must be a
single woman, too, instead of a wife and the devoted
mother of a difficult but promising daughter. She must
be considerably older. She must retain her skill with
the needle, and her piety. So I simply jotted down half
a dozen words to name the several incidents of her dream,
then began to write, visualizing the opening scene as I
went. It was like transcribing at some one else’s dictation
matter already an intimate part of one’s spiritual
life. Isn’t that the way one’s best things come? I
wrote only one rough draft, then the final copy. Hardly
a word was changed. The title, oddly apt, I think, came
to me when I wrote the line, ‘She recreated her earlier
selves and passed them on, happy in the thought that
she was saving them from oblivion.’”</p>

<p>This full description of the constructive process renders
almost superfluous either questions or further comment.
It should be compared closely with Mary Brecht
Pulver’s similar résumé of her “Path of Glory.”</p>

<p>“Little Selves” constitutes a happy cross between the
“evoked ghost” story, such as one finds in Kipling’s
“They,” and the pictures frankly labeled as memories,
in a <a id="multitude"></a>multitude of stories. For as Margaret says, the
earlier selves “is realer” than the children of flesh-and-blood
who surround her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theme.</span> In what does the merit of the narrative lie,—theme,
characterization, or plot? In connection with
your own answer observe that Miss Lerner says, “As for
plot versus theme, I think theme usually dominates. I
have some idea I wish to expound—to illustrate by
means of interplay of character and action. Idea, I
feel, is really <i>The Thing</i>, rather than mere complication
or rapidity of action.”</p>

<p>In how many stories of these collections, do you feel
the dominance of the underlying idea? In which, if any,
is it lacking? In which do you feel the predominance of
idea to such an extent as to swamp the story values?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Show that the sentence on page 224, “Her
voice choked with sudden tears,” is a sort of dramatic
climax.</p>

<p>Why is it more artistic to leave the climax of action,
the old woman’s death, untold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> In what sense is the narrative a “character
story”? Is a whole life really re-constructed? Is
the author’s chief object this re-living?</p>

<p>How is Margaret best visualized for <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>What is Anna’s chief characteristic and what her main
place in the plot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> In what respects is the story a national representative?
How do the two larger settings, as indicated,
aid each other? Which is thrown into subjection?
Why?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WILLOW_WALK">THE WILLOW WALK</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> In constructing his plot, the author devised a
plan whereby a robber might escape with stolen money.
Having invented it, he tested each part to make it <i>seem</i>
detective proof; and in following up this process he created
a novel variety of the detective story genre. Similar
stories have effected a resolution of the complication
by a pull at some loose end left hanging through inadvertence
of the criminal, and have so conserved justice.
Mr. Lewis, avoiding this usual device, has requisitioned
the peculiar advantages of dual personality to bring about
the downfall of his criminal. (Compare with this <i>motif</i>,
the one found in Frederick Stuart Greene’s “Galway
Intrudes,” a story which has much in common with “The
Willow Walk.”)</p>

<p>A thief, therefore, who plans his get-away by first <i>inventing</i>
and then <i>pretending</i> to be his own “brother,”
ultimately becomes the brother. The transformation is
made plausible through the histrionic gifts attributed to
the robber whereby he <i>is</i>, rather than merely <i>acts</i>, the
represented character.</p>

<p>To the end that ultimate confession will occur, the
brother must be religious; to the end that punishment is
efficacious, the confession must be received with incredulity.
These are necessary, if unconscious, preliminaries
to this representative of the series which begins
with Poe’s “William Wilson,” and which includes “Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The author first sets forth details
that lead to the beginning of the action, the most important
of which convey that Jasper Holt is acquiring a new
hand-writing, that he is a respectable paying teller, that
he is a good actor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Action Antecedent to the Present</i>: Read the
story, and find under its superstructure the groundwork
of Jasper’s plan. How much preparation has
been necessary? How long has it required, probably,
to accomplish it? Has the author begun at the best
point possible in the story action?</p>
</div>


<p class="center p1"><i>Incidents of the Complication Leading Immediately to
the Dramatic Climax</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Jasper Holt prepares the hiding place.</p>

<p class="indented16">Taking his car from the garage, Holt starts toward
Rosebank, but turns aside to buy candy, which
he has packed in boxes that imitate books. He purchases
two novels. To one who recognizes him, he
pretends he is looking after bank property. He
reaches Rosebank; he enters the house of the willow
walk, removes the candy to the paper wrapper, and
places the two imitation books, with the novels, on
the bottom shelf of the book-case. (Incidentally,
he makes use of the principle exploited by Poe in
“The Purloined Letter.”)</p>

<p>2. Jasper establishes his identity as “John Holt.”</p>

<p class="indented16">He takes down a religious work, from which he
selects a name to “spring”—Philo Judæus. He
changes his clothes and becomes his own brother, hermit
and religious fanatic. Downstairs he speaks to
a neighbor; he makes purchases at the drug-store and
the grocery; he visits Soul Hope Hall, speaks on
Philo Judæus and prays for his brother Jasper.</p>

<p>3. He removes signs of his recent preparations, and re-establishes
himself as Jasper Holt. (Note the significance
of the Community Theatre scene.)</p>

<p class="indented16">Jasper changes to his own clothes. On his way
to town he throws out the candy and gives away his
groceries. He burns the wrapper, later, in his boarding
house. He takes part in theatricals; it is significant
that he is a good actor, really becoming the part
he plays.</p>

<p>4. Jasper prepares for the robbery and his sure escape.</p>

<p class="indented16">Five days later, he complains of a headache. He
takes a day off. John calls at the bank and emphasizes
the contrast between himself and Jasper. Jasper
afterwards suggests that in the event of his robbing
the bank John would undoubtedly aid in
bringing him to justice (dramatic irony, here).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>5. He completes his preparations outside.</p>

<p class="indented16">“Persuaded” to go away for a week-end, he drives
south to Wanagoochie, but circuits back to St. Clair.
Two miles from Rosebank, he investigates a lake.
En route to St. Clair, he puts his machine out of
order and leaves it at a garage, giving his name as
Hanson. Arriving by train at Vernon, he says his
car is at Wanagoochie. He announces to his landlady
that he is taking two suit-cases to Wakamin.</p>

<p>6. He robs the bank. (Minor climax.) He escapes.</p>

<p class="indented16">With the road clear for flight, he transfers the
parcels of bills to his suit-case. He takes the train
to Wakamin, but gets off at St. Clair and retrieves
his car from the garage. He drives toward Rosebank;
spreads his lunch near the lake. At nightfall
he runs his car over the cliff into the water. With
his suit-cases, he walks into Rosebank, and at the
house of the willow walk destroys all evidence of
himself as Jasper. He stores away $97,535 in the
empty candy boxes. He goes to bed as John Holt.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: “I suppose John would pray,”
etc. Jasper Holt ceases to exist; John begins to exist
as a constant entity.</p>
</div>


<p class="center p1"><i>Incidents of the Solution Leading to the Climax
of Action</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Jasper “acts” John.</p>

<p class="indented16">John learns of the theft, calls on the bank president
and begs that his house be searched. President
gets rid of him. He calls on the detective, who
finally searches John’s house. John directs attention
to the shed where Jasper kept his car. The police
refuse to search. Jasper has thus further entrenched
himself, outwardly, as John.</p>

<p>2. Jasper changes, subtly, to John.</p>

<p class="indented16">John prays for Jasper. He plans a trip south,
but continues his religious studies. It is obvious
that this modern Frankenstein is rapidly becoming
the monster of his own creation. At the end of one
and a half years, he has sloughed off most of his
Jasper nature and acquired that of John.</p>

<p>3. He endures a period of final struggle.</p>

<p class="indented16">The John part of him wishes to confess; the dying
Jasper refuses to take him back to the bank. But
at the Soul Hope Fraternity, he confesses that he
stole. For a week he stays at home; then he goes
out. On his return he discovers that the money is
missing.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: He goes to the bank and confesses;
his story is not believed. He has changed
natures, completely.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: The jail refuses to take him. He
finds work at the sand pits.</p>

<p>For parallelism of the final situation, read Edith
Wharton’s “The Bolted Door.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Bear in mind that the diverse
personalities of Jasper and John are bound up in Jasper,
that although “John” was originally invented and then
assumed, he finally dominated. The dramatic climax
marks the point at which the outer Jasper disappears; the
climax of action marks the disappearance of the inner
Jasper. The man who goes to work at the sand pits is,
essentially, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Suspense, one of the best features, in the
earlier two-thirds of the story, operates progressively,
the cause shifting with the various steps of the action.
For example, perhaps the first important question
aroused is, “What is Jasper doing all this for?” The
second, “Will he succeed in carrying out his well-laid
plans?” Meantime, subordinate questions arise, to be
satisfied by the author in the unfolding of the narrative.
Show that suspense works of necessity less forcibly
toward the end, where the outcome becomes more and
more inevitable.</p>

<p>Do you know what became of the stolen money?
Should that trailing thread be gathered up, or is it better
left as it is?</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis declares that “The Willow Walk” has, so
far as he can remember, no history at all. But he contributes
the following by way of his views on the short-story:</p>

<p>“Technique defeats itself. The more nearly perfect
it becomes, the nearer it is to stagnation. This rule holds
true whether it be applied to ecclesiastical ceremony, to
that humorous art known as ‘the manners of a gentleman,’
to the designing of motor-car bodies, or the practise
of the arts. Once your motor-body designer has
almost approximated the lines of a carriage, an innovator
appears who boisterously ridicules the niceties of that
technique, and, to the accompaniment of howling from
the trained technicians, smashes out a new form, with
monstrous hood and stream-line massiveness. Within
two years he has driven out all the old technique, and is
followed by a ‘school,’ neatly developing a new technique,
in its turn to be perfected—then destroyed by
some vulgarian who is too ignorant or too passionate to
care for the proprieties of design.</p>

<p>“Once the technique of the academic school of painters
of still life and landscape and portraits was practically
perfect, a noisy, ill-bred, passionate crew of destroyers
appeared, under such raucous labels as ‘futurists,’
‘vorticists,’ ‘cubists,’ and despite the fact that their excesses
have not become popular in plush parlors, these
innovations have forever ruined the pleasure of picture-gazers
in the smooth inanity of the perfected old technique.
And now their followers in their turn——! As
I write, the perfect militarist technique of the German
empire has cracked into socialist republics. In time
those republics will build up a perfect technique of bureaus,
and be ready for the cleansing fire.</p>

<p>“Technique defeats itself. I have repeated the word
‘passion’ because that is the force that starts the rout.
The man who is passionate about beauty or scientific facts,
about making love or going fishing or the potentialities of
Russia or revolt against smug oppressors, is likely to find
himself cramped by the technique of the art which he
chooses as a medium, to discard it, and to find a technique
of his own. Austin Dobson could endure the triolet for
the expression of delicate inexactitudes regarding French
curés, but when Shelley was singing a world aflame, he
made for himself a new mode of expression which, to
formalists, seemed inexpressibly crude.</p>

<p>“And so to the short story. I am not afraid of this
new technique of the proper beginning, the correct ending,
the clever dénouement, the geometrically plotted curve of
action—because I do not believe that anybody who passionately
has anything to say is going to cramp himself
by learning its pat rules. But I do believe that—before
they go and smash the technique, anyway!—young
writers may be saved much spiritual struggle if they be
taught that there is nothing sacred, nothing they unquestionably
must follow, in any exactly formulated technique.</p>

<p>“They will, of course, if they succeed, make a technique
of their own. That is a short cut to salvation for them.
It is only when a technique is that of other writers, when
it is so crystallized that it can be definitely exhibited,
that it becomes dangerous. I know that Joseph Hergesheimer
in such absorbingly beautiful short stories as
‘Wild Oranges,’ ‘Tol’able David,’ or ‘Asphodel’ has a
technique, a very definite idea of what he is doing; or
what he is going to do before he starts, and of why he has
done things after he has done them. But he has not
obediently imitated the technique of other writers. None
knows better than Mr. Hergesheimer the great art of such
men as Conrad, Galsworthy, George Moore; but none has
less imitated them, less accepted their technique as his
guidance.</p>

<p>“Curse Stevenson for that ‘playing the sedulous ape,’
which has led so many thousands astray. It was Stevenson’s
weakness, not his strength, that aping; and because
of it his light is flickering, while that of his contemporaries,
Rossetti, Hardy, Swinburne, Flaubert, who were
not sedulous apes but men passionate about beauty or the
curious ways of daily man, burns evenly and forever.
Stevenson had an unequalled opportunity; he was a
pioneer, with a pioneer’s chance to stake out the first
claim; yet once Kipling galloped into sight, roaring at
deft Stevensonian technique, irreverent and violent as one
of his own Rajputs, doing really dreadful things to the
balanced decencies of proportion and melody, he routed
Stevenson in a handful of years ... and today we have
read Stevenson, but we do read Kipling.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course, of course. ‘Freedom is no
excuse for violence.’ ‘The young man must train his
mind.’ ‘From a study of the elders youth learns to
avoid their mistakes’ (but he doesn’t!). ‘Only the
strong are able to govern themselves, to make their own
codes of ethics or of beauty.’ All those sage warnings—used
equally against Martin Luther and the Bolsheviks,
against the bad boy in school and Rodin. Basically, the
disagreement between classicists and modernists is temperamental,
and will, under various guises, endure forever.
Only, let it be clearly recognized for what it is; let
the classicist not mistake himself for a modernist; let the
innovator not suppose because O. Henry is still so living
a force that his followers have not already hardened
his technique into a form classic and very dead.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WEAVER_WHO_CLAD">THE WEAVER WHO CLAD
THE SUMMER</h2>
</div>


<p><i>Comment.</i>—The death of Harris Merton Lyon gives
added poignancy to the story whose idealism and inspiration
made for it a place in the first of Mr. O’Brien’s
collections. Judged by the test of Beauty, it is perhaps
first on the list. The satisfaction vouchsafed each
reader will be in proportion to his own Spirit of Work
and his acceptance of the theme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theme.</span> Since the Idea is foremost, it is quite fitting
that it should be sounded early. The first approach is
on page one (153, Yearbook) and in the form of a
wonder as to what there could possibly be “in being
a worker at the other, the evanescent thing.” The answer,
or the satisfaction of the wonder, is given in the
essential story, stripped of its covering, pages 158-170.
The theme is emphasized, strongly, in the sentence on
page 170: “<i>You did the Work of your Hand!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Inner Story</span>, which allegorically satisfies the
questioner, is the beautifully tenuous tale of the Mariner.
It is woven of words in a style perfectly to suggest the
spirit of summer and the evanescence of her garments,
yet underneath the light superstructure are the foundations
of the short-story. The <i>struggle</i> of the weaver,
Andy Gordon, was successfully repeated for forty years.
He died, knowing that he had been “a master-worker in
a fabric that immediately dissolved,” yet content. His
death is the <i>dénouement</i> of the tale, just as the dialogue
between the Voice and Andy (pages 159-161) forms the
<i>initial incident</i>. What is the <i>dramatic climax</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> Andy Gordon’s story is told in an
Italian restaurant, Pigalle’s, over a poker table. The
narrator is at first denominated the Ancient Mariner;
eventually he proves to be the Andy Gordon of his tale.
(See pages 158 and 171.) What new evaluation of the
weaver’s story do you make after learning that Andy
was a violinist? Had you guessed any part of the whole
situation before reading to the dénouement of the enveloping
story? The narrator of the external action is,
presumably, the author himself, who uses the first person
“I.”</p>

<p>Contrast, between the restaurant scene and character
on the one hand and the summer scenes with Andy on
the other, is the chief aid used to enhance the narrative.
Point out particular examples of its operation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Division I emphasizes the character of the
Mariner, at the same time it repeats the theme. (See
above), in the words, “Sufficient unto eternity is the
glory of the hour.” Why does the author give an entire
division (III) to the lines: “Abruptly the old man
left and went out into the snowy night. For there were
tears in his eyes.”</p>

<p>What value has the reference to Bernhardt, page 153?</p>

<p>Why is it well to set the rehearsal on a <i>snowy</i> evening?
(Study the story for the answer.) Where is Pigalle’s
restaurant?</p>

<p>What effect has the tinkling of the door-bell, at eleven
o’clock?</p>

<p>What principle of emphasis is at work on the description
of the maid who bore the “sweet ineffable
name of Philomene”? On the Mariner (as described,
page 155)?</p>

<p>What do you gather from the absinthe and the
<i>cigarettes jaunes</i>?</p>

<p>What addition is made to the comprehension of the
Mariner in the suggested resemblance to Socrates and
to Verlaine?</p>

<p>What colors and materials are used in Summer’s
dresses? Would others have served as well? After
knowing the dénouement (that Andy was a violinist)
how do you interpret the passage “Andy was about
twenty-eight years old then,” etc., through the words
“done by hand”? What other passages need similar
interpretation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> “You ask about the germinal idea
of ‘The Sun Chaser.’ How can I tell you, for how do
I know, what the germinal idea of my story is! I can
recognize it after the story is written. But that makes
it all the more difficult to say with certainty that the ‘idea’
is germinal. What Ambrose seeks is what every one of
us in the world—even a Sun Chaser—wants: <span class="allsmcap">HAPPINESS</span>.
And the more ill-balanced or crippled a nature is,
the more importunate is this demand for happiness....</p>

<p>“It is easier to tell you how I came to write ‘The Sun
Chaser’ than to tell you anything about it.... Early
one morning in October I was sitting at my writing table
in my little log cabin up in the Maine wilderness. It
was about half past five, and I had started my fire and
had my cup of cocoa and my crust of bread and was
ready for work. But I sat there watching the dawn.
Ahead of me I had one of the endless pot-boilers to
do by means of which I provided bread and butter and
met my responsibilities. The very thought of doing
another of these ‘things’ made me feel ill and tired.
Suddenly up over the field before my cabin with the
dawn I saw the fleeing figure of the <span class="allsmcap">SUN CHASER</span> running
towards me. More I cannot tell you except that
it was like listening to wonderful music as I sat there
seeing the story unfold. I did nothing that morning
except ‘listen.’ And for the next month I did no pot-boilers,
but work on this story.... January first of
that year I took up college lecturing and since then I
have written no pot-boilers....”—<i>Jeannette Marks.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A novelette of twelve divisions, almost
epical. (But see Miss Marks’s own comment, below.
It is noteworthy that the present analyst uses the
word “epic” to characterize the story, whereas Miss
Marks sees in it a <i>lack</i> of the epic quality. Or so the
implication runs.)</p>

<p>Apart from length, the character interest shifts from
the Sun Chaser to his daughter, and his wife; the
dénouement emphasizes the child’s sacrifice. The epilogue
emphasizes the inhumanity of man to man, and its
abeyance in one case because of the sacrifice.</p>

<p>(The designation of the work as a novelette is, in all
its bearings, indicative of values greater than those of
the short-story.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Enumerate the earlier stages of the plot action.
The <i>dramatic climax</i> is formed by the vividly summarized
struggle between the Sun Chaser and his wife and child.
Important <i>steps toward the end of the action</i> are: the
placing of the Sun Chaser in the town lock-up; the
mother’s leaving Pearl alone while she goes to return
the wash; Pearl’s journeying to feed her father. (This
journey is, in itself, the largest struggle <i>within</i> the narrative;
for, the struggle to find happiness—as Miss
Marks has indicated—is the chief one.) Study the
various phases of the child’s battle against the forces of
nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Climax of Action.</i> Pearl falls in the snow.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement.</i> Her body is found.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The most remarkable characterization
exists in the case of the Sun Chaser. Miss
Marks’s ability to reflect the mentality of his brain is particularly
worthy of study.</p>

<p>In contrast to the Chaser, and yet not in violent opposition,
is his wife. Study her portrait, looking for her
sense of the practical, softened by her own love and
gentleness. What reaction on <i>you</i> is effected by her
effort to keep her husband from the lock-up?</p>

<p>Pearl is tenderly and delicately drawn, and yet she
evinces the practicality of her mother. See, e.g., pages
227, 244. In what ways is she the character who most
compels sympathy? Would she do so, apart from the
final supreme sacrifice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> The clip-clop of Ambrose’s walk is a good
example of the <i>sound</i> effects which increase the dramaturgic
quality. Point out other instances. The lamp in
Ambrose’s home, “torch of flame and blackened stream
of smoke,” is illustrative of the <i>color</i> contribution. Give
other examples. But, in this story, greater in value than
either sound or color is the sense of motion. Mr. O’Brien
calls attention to the “rhythmical progression” of the
narrative. To this suggestion, add your own interpretation
of the movement. Is there in the idea of the
search for happiness a connotation of something never
achieved, never-ended? and with the search a constant
necessity for “Going—going—going”?</p>

<p>How does the story affect you emotionally? With
regard to individual moments, how does the behavior of
the liquor dealer move you? Is “contempt” the feeling
you have for him, or is it stronger? What is your
predominant feeling for Ambrose? Sympathy is incited
through a combination of human relationships:
1. Pearl’s love for her father; 2. Sybil Clarke’s love for
Pearl, and 3. her pity for Ambrose, her husband. What
reaction is aroused by the incident wherein Pearl and
David figure?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Author’s Comment.</span> “Is ‘The Sun Chaser’ any
longer than some of Stevenson’s short stories, or Balzac’s
or Guy de Maupassant’s?... And what is a short story,
anyhow? Isn’t the range of narrative the question involved
in a short story? In a play I can tell from the
‘feel’ of the material whether it is a one-acter or full
dress length. Isn’t there a suggestion of the epic tendency
in the novelettes as well as the novel:—the incidental
use of incident, for example, contributing to the
sense of mass? This is the sort of tendency one may
not admit to short story or play where concentration is
so much greater. As I see it, now that it is done, ‘The
Sun Chaser’ structurally as well as spiritually is marked
by extreme concentration, and for that reason, personally,
it would seem to me to be a short story.... The
short story appeals to me from the technical point of
view because it is more perfect than the novel, even as
I consider the play to be more perfect structurally than
the short story. I believe in concrete foundations and
steel superstructures, and these, I think, can be built for
the play, but not for the short story any more than for
the poem.... It seems to me that the well-equipped
artist always has a feeling for structure. Analysis, however,
does not precede creation. Because of the nature
of the creative artist’s mind, it does not necessarily follow
creation, either. There may be actual inability to analyze.
It’s as difficult to see the sum total of the work you’ve
done as to see the sum total of yourself. The creative
artist is not an analytical chemist of his own mental
processes.... I have no standards.... I think that
the thing which ‘arrives’ in short story or play is, like
beauty, ‘its own excuse for being.’”—<i>Jeannette Marks.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_VINTON_HEARD">THE STORY VINTON HEARD
AT MALLORIE</h2>
</div>


<p>In this work Miss Moseley has presented a story of the
war, a narrative of the supernatural having points in
common with Mr. Rhodes’s “Extra Men.” In each,
there is the spirit-world visitor, in each the truth conveyed
by him which gives the story its thematic character,
and in each the living power of the dead made manifest.
As I have pointed out in “Representative Ghosts”
(<i>The Bookman</i>, August, 1917), and elsewhere, mankind
will be interested in ghosts so long as earth endures.
The most decided impetus to fiction given by the war has
been, so far, in the direction of the supernatural. It is
interesting to know that Mr. O’Brien considers this and
Frances Gilchrist Wood’s “The White Battalion” the
two most enduring legends contributed this year to the
supernatural literature of the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Young Mallorie is killed in action.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax</i>: His body is taken home
to Mallorie Abbey, where masses are held over it.
A Zeppelin appears, ready to discharge bombs just
over the chapel, when an aeroplane swoops noiselessly
down; the Zeppelin falls. The Germans are
all killed. The aeronaut descends. He accepts the
invitation to stay awhile at Mallorie Abbey and remains
almost a week. Lieutenant Templar, as he
calls himself, occupies dead young Mallorie’s room
and wears his clothes. He plays tennis and behaves
in general like a normal healthy young Englishman,
but that he has unusual powers is evinced by
the words of the visiting general officer, “How does
he <i>know</i>?”</p>

<p><i>The Climax</i>: Lady Maurya’s questions of the
aeronaut terminate in the answer, “Because in me
is the strength,” etc., revealing his supernatural character.
He disappears.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The single incident becomes subdued,
rather than emphasized, by representing it as told to Vinton
who, in turn, repeats it to Ware and Abigail.
Credulity is gained in assuming for each narrator an implied
or expressed belief,—“I said to her that I was the
most believing man since the Dark Ages.” And their
faith acts cumulatively to compel the reader’s acceptance.
By rehearsing in New England the story of English background
and atmosphere, Miss Moseley gains for it sharpness
and, at the same time, a certain <i>nuance</i>. The
stormy night supposedly affects the hearers’ credulity, and
through them, once more, the reader’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comment and Query.</span> “For me,” says Mr. Muilenburg,
“the best story is the one that gives the reader
the greatest after-mood, and this can be done with very
little action. To give the feeling of an environment, to
show character absolutely in a life-like manner, and to
give nature and man an equal place: these I consider
necessary to almost every story.”</p>

<p>Using his own criterion, how well has Mr. Muilenburg
succeeded in every respect mentioned above? What
mood does the story give you? Where is the environment?
Does the feeling that arises from it emphasize
the general atmosphere?</p>

<p>Pages 172 and 173 introduce the boy, Frank, in his
setting. Which is more important—character or place?
Again measure your answer by the author’s ideals.</p>

<p>“Both stories have kept close to realism,” says Mr.
Muilenburg, “as the greater part of both have been
taken from my own experience, and circumstances are
reproduced rather than fancied.” Is there anything in
the characterization of the boy that tells you he is, in
some measure, a reflection of the author himself?</p>

<p>“Isn’t it possible,” asks the author, “that only the
stories that have some situation where the characters
must be shown in primitive fashion are enduring?”
How would you answer this question in general? What
is the situation in this story? May it be termed “primitive”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details of Composition.</span> Pages 173, 174 recount an
incident which shows the elements of conflict in the boy’s
soul. How does it prepare for the greater struggle?
(See pages 179, 180, 181.) What purpose has the scene
between Frank and Bill with respect to later developments
and particularly the struggle?</p>

<p>What contribution to the boy’s character is made in
his ceasing work only when the shadow of the cottonwood
tree pointed north? in his taking the milk-pails
from the hooks? (Page 182.)</p>

<p>In the “heart of youth” conflict (page 180) what
emotions are arrayed against each other?</p>

<p>What value has the episode of the bird and the snake?
What conditions make it an integral part of the action,
not a forced parallel?</p>

<p>What details of setting and circumstance, and what
traits in the boy combine to solicit your sympathy?</p>

<p>The little story is unified in character, place and time.
It reveals by concrete symbol the significant phases of
the struggle. It performs a <i>tour de force</i> in avoiding
an extended analysis of the boy’s psychology. Even
though the narrative is told from Frank’s “angle,” the
reader knows what he thinks by what he does and says,
rather than by the author’s analysis of his mental state.
Further, the work makes a small contribution to literary
history, since it is representative of a period of life in
the Middle West, through which the author has passed;
and it is reflected there now, to some extent. The fact
that there is a strong vein of poetry throughout is because
“poetry is found naturally in the life of a people
who must struggle with a hard physical environment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clayton Hamilton says in “A Manual of the Art
of Fiction” (page 187), “—although the novel may be
either realistic or romantic in general method, the short-story
is almost of necessity obliged to be romantic. In
the brief space allotted to him, it is practically impossible
for the writer of short-stories to induce a general truth
from particular, imagined facts imitated from actuality:
it is far simpler to deduce the imagined details of the
story from a central thesis, held securely in the author’s
mind and suggested to the reader at the outset. It is a
quicker process to think from the truth to facts than
to think from facts to the truth.” And in illustration
of his statement, he adds that Daudet and de Maupassant,
who worked realistically in their novels, worked romantically
in their <i>contes</i>, also that the great short-story
writers of our own language have been, nearly all of
them, romanticists—from Poe to Kipling.</p>

<p>With this interesting tenet in mind, look over all
the realistic stories in the four volumes we are studying,
and try to apply to each the same methods by which the
romantic stories are studied. Does the application break
down? How far can you follow it? Try, for example,
to analyze the plot of “At the End of the Road”
according to the type used again and again in this book.</p>

<p>Why is this story told in the first person? Try telling
it in the third person, beginning that is, “The latter part
of the summer found <i>him</i> tramping,” etc., and see what
is lost.</p>

<p>Recall stories which have for setting a picnic ground,
a fair ground, or other community gathering. Read
Thomas Hardy’s “On the Western Circuit.” (In
“Life’s Little Ironies.”) Why is such a setting good for
many types of story—whether realistic, romantic, comic,
tragic?</p>

<p>Who is the central figure in Mr. Muilenburg’s Iowa
story? Would his story gain importance if detached
from the subjectivity of the narrator—if the musings,
observations and feelings were cut? What would happen
to the whole narrative if such a change were made?
Sum up the gist of the “story” in a few words.</p>

<p>What is the struggle? Wherein lies the human appeal?</p>

<p>What is the end of the action? How do you know?</p>

<p>The drunkard is an age-old figure, whether humorous
or tragic. What is the essential difference between the
tragic and the humorous portrayal? Why, for instance,
does one laugh at an actor who plays the part of Cassio,
in the drinking-scene from “Othello”? Why does one
“feel sorry for” Bill as here conceived?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>What theme is lightly touched and where?</p>

<p>What has this example of Mr. Muilenburg’s work in
common with the preceding story by him?</p>

chromatic effects? Is it in harmony with the other story-elements?

<p>The artistry of the author has worked consciously or
unconsciously to create a finished piece of work. Told
as a single episode in the experience of a traveler, it has
the <i>magnitude</i> of the short-story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proportion.</span> This essential is placed first, here, as
being the chief means by which the effect is obtained.
This effect comes, cumulatively, and is increased by giving
climactic value to a coincidence. The coincidence,
properly prepared for, is not of the kind that would have
had great worth at the end of a longer story.</p>

<p>To illustrate how it might have been diminished, rather
than increased:</p>

<p>Throw the time back to the youth of Giovanni and
Rosa. Develop, at length, the love affair of the two
young people. (This, alone, would require several
pages.) Show the struggle of the girl, torn between
religion and love. Present her prayer to the Virgin, the
answer, and her decision (done dramatically, all this,
perhaps in two pages), and her entrance into the nunnery.
(So much would be done, logically, from Rosa’s point of
view.) Shifting the spot-light to Giovanni, show him
stabbing the picture of the Virgin; his disappearance;
his meeting the funeral, and his being informed of Rosa’s
death. The fact that it occurred at the time he stabbed
the picture, as the coincidence, revealed after so long a
development, would lack comparative height or worth.</p>

<p>Consider such treatment, and by force of comparison
see that the author did best to treat the occurrences at
a time long after they happened. The rehearsed story
is in this instance undoubtedly the best. Further, by its
use, the last words (page 188), “I am Giovanni,” are
possible, intensifying the effect.</p>

<p>Considering the plot, what should you say are the
chief steps in the development? Analyze both the inner
story and in its relation to the enveloping action. The
initial impulse, for instance, in the whole narrative is,
the motivation for the monk’s telling his story. The
dénouement, similarly, is the fact that Giovanni and the
monk are identical. What are initial impulse and
dénouement of the rehearsed narrative?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> What is the worth of the setting in such a
story, both as regards unity and convincingness? Note
all the details which are distinctly Italian. What connotation
have the cypress trees? Do they intensify the
mood? In connection with the immediate scene in the
chapel, what value has the sentence, “Beneath it, on a
little stand, lay a slim-bladed vicious knife, covered
with dust”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> What added <i>theme</i> is conveyed in
the description, “He was old, the oldest man Blagden
had ever seen, etc.”? Does one get it on first reading,
or on reflection?</p>

story?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> “You are right,” says Mr. O’Brien,
“about ‘The Whale and the Grasshopper.’ It is a
sort of fable and like the other sketches in my book it
was written for the sake of the philosophy and humor.
The starting point of the narrative was the remark of
Padna Dan ‘As the Whale said to the Grasshopper,’
which I considered a good title, and accordingly wrote the
phantasy.”</p>

<p>Read as a sort of parallel, Emerson’s “The Mountain
and the Squirrel.” What is the difference in the mental
attitude of the two authors?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Why is such a fable particularly well set
near Castlegregory on a June morning? Note the intensifying
of the setting by means of dialect. Would
the place be realized without the Irish speech? Study
the selective processes used to make the dialect easy to
understand and yet distinctly characteristic of the Green
Isle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> Standish McNeill and Felix O’Dowd
seem to be real people,—at the very beginning, because
of their names. The writer who is less careful would
have endowed them with Mike or Pat. How are they
kept up from start to finish as real? Why, for example,
do you know they took that walk? What characteristic
(at once Celtic and individual) of Standish enables
him to “put across” so vividly a yarn which one <i>knows</i>
all along can be only fable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Methods.</span> Mr. O’Brien states that he does
not know how much he believes in or practices technical
distinctions. “Writing, I think, is the art that must
evolve out of ourselves. I began life as an artist and
specialized in sculpture, but finding there were things I
could not express through such a medium I took to writing.
When I am impressed by some important event,
it fashions itself in story or drama form in my mind,
without any conscious effort on my part, and when I
feel intelligent—which is not often—I write.”</p>

<p>“In Berlin” is a <i>tour de force</i> of short-story construction.
Miss O’Reilly has followed the well-known principle
of beginning near the climax, that the story may
gain intensity. The result is excellent for this one principle.
But the whole composition of 125 or 150 words
in reality plays up a single dramatic moment—not a
single Incident.</p>

<p>The advantage to the student in reproducing similar
“dramatic moment” stories will be to show the value
of material in magnitude and worth, to teach him to appreciate
climax, and to feel the advantages—and the
disadvantages—of economy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INTERVAL">THE INTERVAL</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> Mr. O’Sullivan states that the story
arose primarily from his foreseeing, in 1915, that one
result of the War would be a revived interest in the supernatural.
This foreknowledge illustrates that the author
must be a little ahead of his time, rather than a little
behind it.</p>

<p>The clearness of his prevision is illustrated in such
stories as Gordon Arthur Smith’s “Jeanne the Maid”
(1915), Edith Wharton’s “Kerfol” (1916), Alice
Brown’s “The Flying Teuton” (1917), and Frances
Wood’s “The White Battalion” (1918). It would be
safe to hazard that these authors foresaw a similar demand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Title.</span> Meaning of “The Interval”? Is it apt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Why did the author choose London, rather
than an American city? Is it clear from the story alone
that Mr. O’Sullivan is thoroughly familiar with English
locale and character?</p>

<p>In the first paragraph occurs the sentence, “A dense
haze, gray and tinged ruddy, lay between the houses,
sometimes blowing with a little wet kiss against the
face.” What color effects are in harmony with the
atmosphere of the story?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The <i>struggle</i> is in the mind of Mrs. Wilton.
She wishes to be assured that “it was not all over, that
he was somewhere, not too far away,” etc., page 385.
The <i>situation</i> is here disclosed, suspense having been used
as to Mrs. Wilton’s purpose in the previous pages. “This
must be the tenth seer she had consulted since Hugh
had been killed,” page 384 is the most revelatory sentence.</p>

<p>Is the struggle successful?</p>

<p>The <i>initial incident</i> is this visit to the clairvoyant who
“sees” Hugh.</p>

<p>Which of the incidents constitutes the <i>dramatic climax</i>?</p>

<p>“She slipped out of bed hastily ...” (page 390) is
the <i>climax of action</i>, or as much as is expressed. The
reader must finish it for himself.</p>

<p>(The final sentence, with seeming carelessness dropping
the information that “after her death the slippers could
never be found,” is an incentive to the reader’s fancy.
It has no plot value, except by <i>suggestion</i>.)</p>

<p>Did Hugh really return, or did Mrs. Wilton see him
as a logical result of her brooding? If the former choice
is made, the inference is that the reader accepts Hugh
as a bona fide ghost; if the latter, then he is only existent
through the sick-woman’s mind and the mind of the
clairvoyant. (See article, “Representative Ghosts,”
<i>Bookman</i>, August, 1917.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Does the author believe the clairvoyant was
genuine? If so, why does he say (page 384), “A look of
complicity, of cunning, perhaps of irony, passed through
the dealer’s cynical and sad eyes”?</p>

<p>Are the visitations of Hugh arranged in climactic order?</p>

<p>Is Mrs. Wilton’s illness adequately motivated? What
is the double explanation of it? Do you accept the natural
or the supernatural reason?</p>

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: On August 16, 1866, at Paris,
Vermont, was held a banquet in honor of sixty-odd
returned heroes. It was called the “Forty-Five”
banquet in honor of the boys who had not returned.
Captain Jack Fuller proposed to save one bottle of
vintage, the seal of which should be broken when in
the course of years only two of the sixty heroes remained.
On their final reunion they would drink a
toast to “Forty-Five.”</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Dramatic Climax</i>: Captain Jack
was the first to join Forty-Five. He left a son, who
grew up, married, and died, leaving a son, young
Jack Fuller.</p>

<p>In 1910, eleven heroes are living; by August 16,
1912, the ranks have dwindled to four old men. On
August 17, 1912, Jack Fuller, grandson of Captain
Jack of Civil War fame, in a drunken fit accidentally
kills his baby. Sobered by the tragedy, he promises
reformation. Succeeding months witness his hard
struggle. He wishes, as a final safeguard, to join the
National Guardsmen, but his wife, Betty, begs him
to stay with her—she cannot bear alone the memories.
Jack raises a company, becomes their captain,
and drills them as Fuller’s Fire-eaters. (The Mexican
trouble motivates this step.) In August, 1916,
three of the Forty-Five are left: Henry Weston,
Uncle Joe Fodder, and Wilber Nieson. In February,
1917, the United States severs relations with
Germany. In July, half of Fuller’s Fire-eaters have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
been called upon to make up the Paris quota. Jack’s
name has not been drawn; but he wishes to enlist, the
more so as his men will enlist in a body, not waiting
for the draft. Betty implores him to remain; as she
breaks down <a id="physically"></a>physically, he is torn between love and
duty. Wilber Nieson and Henry Weston die.
Only Uncle Joe is left; the toast cannot be pledged,
after all, as planned.</p>

<p>Jack makes up his mind to enlist with his whole
Company—Minor Climax. A dinner is proposed
for them in place of the old reunion. Hundreds of
Parisians gather; the largest assembly hall obtainable
is crowded. Sam Hod, editor, is toastmaster
by virtue of having three sons in the Fire-eaters.
Uncle Joe Fodder sits at his right. Captain Jack
Fuller at his left. Hod announces that Uncle Joe
has requested that the toast to Forty-Five be given
under the present circumstances. Uncle Joe offers
a toast to Captain Jack Fuller and his posterity.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Jack’s glass is raised; as he
hears the words of Uncle Joe, he sees his wife’s face.
He pours out the wine and makes his toast with
water.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Betty sends Jack away—with
a smile—and she goes to work at the box factory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Starting Point.</span> Mr. Pentz states, regarding
the story and its inception, “Substantially true in fact,
it was told and retold to appreciative friends; then it was
written at their suggestion. Probably it gathered moss
during its latent existence and probably something was
lost....”</p>

<p>Technically, the story is an Incident. It has, however,
an underlying significance elevating it above the Incident
type. This significance becomes manifest in the dénouement,
which reveals the influence of Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The story is told by the omniscient
author, who uses Paul’s “slant.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> South Boston, March, 1860. Point out details
which keep the locality before the reader from beginning
to end. Why 1860, rather than 1861 or 1862?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The plot being slight requires only a clear exposition
of events in natural order. The author has
made use of his one chance to create suspense and
utilized it in holding up the name of the Big Stranger.
One suspects, but is not sure until the last words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Character.</span> The main value of the story lies in its description
of Lincoln, both in the words of the author—from
Paul’s angle—and by what the great man says
and does. Which is more forceful?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Pentz’s prescription for a story is brief: “Having
the material write it out.” He believes, further, in
the use of simple language. “The average reader must
not be sent to the dictionary; it divides the interest and
weakens the effect. A writer should eliminate his personality
altogether; what he may know of other languages,
or of intricate English, will not interest a reader
who is busy with a villain in pursuit of the heroine.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_CERTAIN_RICH_MAN">“A CERTAIN RICH MAN—”</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A perfect specimen of the short-story,
even of the extreme type-form since all the unities
are beautifully maintained. The setting is a dinner table
in a home of wealth and refinement; the time is the
present; the length of the action is, perhaps, an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point, and First Stages of Construction.</span>
The author was present at a dinner where a young man
of wealth, the host, remarked in the course of a discussion
of the war that he would willingly give his life if
through that sacrifice he could bring an end to the blood
glut. The remark impressed every one deeply and was
discussed at length. After due thought, Mr. Perry feeling
the “story” in the situation, decided that it lay in
having the man make good. He mulled the matter over
for weeks before finding an answer to his next difficulty
“In what way could he make good?” Then there occurred
to him the expedient of having present an inventor
who had invented an appliance which through its complete
death dealing qualities would end the war forthwith.
Here, then, was the complete thread of the story.
Characters and descriptive background followed in due
course. The author has an objection to sad endings and
would like to have made it clear that the man came
through his test safely. But the whole spirit of the story
militated against this. So he left the outcome uncertain,
but the inference is that Colcord yielded his life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> There are nine persons, each
deftly made a living part of the assembly. They are, in
approximate order of importance: Nicholas Colcord and
his wife Evelyn. (They may be spoken of as untried
gold); Professor Simec (the assayer); Jeffery Latham
and Sybil his wife (tried gold); Arnold Bates (alloy);
Jerry Dane and his wife Bessie (baser metal); Dr. Allison
and his wife(?).</p>

<p>In spite of the rather generous number of characters,
the part each has is so definite, serving by contrast and
comparison to emphasize the main character—Nicholas
Colcord—as to seem well-nigh indispensable. Moreover,
apart from plot values and unity of effect, the number
at the table works for verisimilitude. It is just the
right size for a party in a conservative home, and it embraces
the variety of types one finds in any similar
group.</p>

<p>The dramatic method of characterizing is used to greatest
extent: the men and women describe themselves in
their remarks and in their behavior, particularly in the
matter of measuring up to the test proposed. Go through
the story with an eye to the speeches of each. Is any one
person given many remarks? Who is the prominent
spokesman? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analysis of Plot as Presented.</span> The <i>first significant
step</i> in the action lies in Nick’s remark (page 399)
that he would give his life if in so doing he could end
the war. (The foil to this remark is in Bates’s, “I’m
with Nick.”)</p>

<p>The <i>dramatic climax</i> is sounded on page 403: “Suppose ...
that I could make this absurd condition ...
exist....” It is emphasized in the clear call on page
404: “I am going to ask you to make your offer good.”</p>

<p><i>The climax of action</i> lies in Colcord’s words (page
408): “When do you want me?” (This speech is
emphasized by contrast in Bates’s, “I withdraw right
here.” It is strengthened by Evelyn’s acceptance of her
husband’s sacrifice.)</p>

<p><i>The dénouement</i> is left to the reader.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Carefully study the circumstances preceding
the initial impulse of the story action noting the
details of preparation. For example, the “national
colors merged with those of the allied nations” (page
391); “Rumor credited to him at least one of the deadliest
chemical combinations” (page 392); “There’s a
sort of grace given, I fancy” (page 396); “Sacrifice,
Mrs. Colcord” (page 397) deepening the note of patriotism.</p>

<p>Whose angle of narration is used? Does the author
anywhere depart from it, preferring his own angle?
Does he anywhere seem to turn from the angle of the
chosen one, putting her under the spot-light, instead?
If you find these shifts, can you justify them by showing
that the author makes a gain greater than the loss he
sustains? If he makes no shift, how does he widen
the narrow range afforded only one person?</p>

<p>By what preparation does Mr. Perry create the needed
impression that the Colcords were fully aware of the
sacrifice involved? (Note, especially, the preparation
in Evelyn’s response to Latham’s comment, page 393,
... “you make me shiver!”)</p>

<p>Page 405: “He raised a thin forefinger and levelled
it along the table.” What image is called up?</p>

<p>By what detailed description and exposition does Mr.
Perry make you “believe,” at least momentarily, that
Simec had really invented the appliance?</p>

<p>What locale is suggested, outside the immediate setting?
Does it matter, in a narrative of this kind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> Mr. Perry’s views should be spread abroad
to all who would master the art of story writing. “No
art is rarer, or more difficult of attainment.... First
there is the plot. I think the good short story demands
a plot. Stylistic writing designed to atone for
the lack of a definite idea, or to stand in lieu of a definitely
worked out plot is not to my way of thinking a
pure short story. There must be a plot, a plot peculiar
to itself and peculiar to the medium in which it is set
forth. Very rarely, I believe, may the perfect short
story plot be adapted to any other vehicle. Nine times
out of ten it would not serve as the motif of the play,
the novel, the film or the sketch. The piece of short
fiction, thus, is <i>sui generis</i>. Again the scope is limited.
There may be no leisurely characterization, no extended
dissertation; descriptions are admissible only where they
assist in carrying on the action—or at least do not interfere
with it—and in the telling of the tale there is
no place in the scheme for aught save the ultimate objective.</p>

<p>“Thus carried out and presented in type we have something
which we may regard as the polished gem of literature,
establishing a mood in the reader out of all proportion
to its size—and perhaps its importance. For the
short story very largely is designed for entertainment,
and rarely bears the moral purpose of the great novel or
the didactic intent of the essay.</p>

<p>“I say ‘very largely.’ There are, of course, short
stories written with a purpose—some great ones—but
that purpose is best realized when the essential characteristics
of the story form are observed, when the reader
in other words feels whatever emotions, or grasps whatever
lesson the writer intended to convey, through the
medium of a strong, deeply marked plot carried with
precision from situation to clash to dénouement.”—<i>Lawrence
Perry.</i></p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point and First Processes.</span> “It so happens
in the case of ‘The Path of Glory’ that I can give
you exactly the germinal idea from which the story
sprang. Three months before I wrote it a friend put
into my hand two letters. The first was written by Piatt
Andrew of The American Ambulance at Paris and gave
the full details of a wonderful funeral accorded a young
American volunteer driver who was killed on an early
trip; the second was the last personal letter of the young
man to his family—the letter of a young man of education
and breeding and in no way similar to the Nat letter
of my story save as they both expressed a fundamental
human longing. Copies were being made and I was
offered some. I carried mine home and laid them by.
But they haunted me. ‘There’s a story there,’ I thought.
However, I didn’t seem to get a story—at once. Nevertheless
my mind played with the letters. That funeral!
The story of course lay there, but how to set it off,
enhance it properly. One day thinking it over idly—I
have a vagabond mind and never attack a problem in any
logical fashion—the solution dawned quite suddenly.
It would be best set off by contrast, of course, with some
unthinkably shabby funeral, and would receive its greatest
force by being reconstructed through the minds of a
people to whom a funeral is a precious event.”—<i>Mary
Brecht Pulver.</i></p>

<p>After a statement to the effect that she knows “people
to whom the trappings and ceremonials of death
take on a sense of privilege,” Mrs. Pulver continues:</p>

<p>“Just here I got some paper and a pencil and wrote
the story. Or rather it wrote itself—as my stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
usually do. When I began describing the lonely farm
in which my people lived I had not the least idea who
the people were—how many, what sex, age, race, or
previous condition of servitude. There was a family
in that house. A family preferably in hard luck. Then
at the foot of the hill I saw a lame boy driving a cow.
I walked along with him—and recognizing him as Luke,
and acquainting myself with his ideas and frame of
mind, I knew of course who his people were, how many,
their habits, their names—‘all’s to it,’ as Luke would
have said.</p>

<p>“And so I told their story—and about how one of
them went to France and got killed. And how indirectly
he helped them out of their hard luck. That is
all there was to ‘The Path of Glory.’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Note, first, that since the presentation is consistently
from Luke’s angle, the plot events are given
in chronological order <i>for him</i>; but that from the point
of view of actual occurrence they are presented with some
inversion. (For example, the experience of Mrs. Haynes
in the town precedes her summary to Luke.) In this
respect, the author—perhaps unconsciously—shows
ability to mass plot material to best advantage through
artistic adherence to one angle of narration. Many
short-story writers appear to understand this principle,
yet fail to master it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: The story impulse lies, dormant,
in the business of <a id="Nat"></a>Nat’s funeral. Where does it
become active?</p>

<p><i>Main Steps in Action</i>: Nat’s visit home. A direct
forecast of the climax lies in the reason for his
going to Europe. Another important stage is the
death and burial of Father Haynes, “Paw.”</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: The combination of “Paw’s”
home-made burial and Nat’s death. The two come
near together and constitute the lowest turn of the
Haynes wheel of fortune. In Nat’s death lies the
possibility for change. (In the presentation of
the plot, this climax is <i>reported</i> through the letter, the
reception of which is, in itself, a step toward the
<i>climax of action</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: The letter
telling of Nat’s death. Mrs. Haynes’s stony grief.
The second letter; Nat’s funeral and the <i>croix de
guerre</i>. “Maw” awakes; she is “going downtown.”
She shows the letter, and soon understands that
Nat has given glory to Stony Brook. The letter
is to be published. It is to be read aloud at the
schoolhouse and Nat’s story retold. There will be a
memorial service at the churches. There will be
a big public service in the Town Hall. (Other
details make the change of fortune explicit and
complete.)</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: “Maw” returns home, rehabilitated,
and rehearses the day’s experience to
Luke. He recognizes that Nat has done “somethin’
big for us all.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> If one test of the “short-story” is
that no character should enter who does not assist in
the action, will this story stand it? What, for example,
is Tom’s part? Would you give him up? Is it permissible
to introduce characters to enrich the action? There
is no question about the value from a literary consideration.</p>

<p>The part of each main character is well-defined. Luke,
self-conscious, lame and sensitive, offers the medium
through whom the story is told. “Maw” suffers; it is
she to whom the turns of fortune mean most; she is the
chief character. “Paw” is the cause of the Haynes
status in the community. Nat, the prodigal, is the one
through whom rehabilitation comes.</p>

<p>The personalities that enrich the action are: 1. Clem,
his wife, and S’norta. They do so (a) by intensifying
“Maw’s” sense of poverty, (b) by furnishing contrast
in worldly goods and in character; 2. Tom. His misfortune
enhances the wretchedness of the main actors,
and the probability of his being made sound in mind
emphasizes their changed fortunes. 3. Background characters.
All, practically, whom Mrs. Haynes meets on
her famous day in the town.</p>

<p>Apply to these primary and secondary characters the
tests suggested in previous exercises. Do they <i>live</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> What does “Stony Brook, New York”
suggest by way of physical and spiritual conditions?
How is the locality an integral part of the atmosphere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> The “human appeal” in this narrative will
make it hard for any reader, however crusty, to refrain
from tears or an awakened sense of pity. By what measures
has the author brought about this desired result?
The list should be long. After you have made it, see
how far you can generalize from it as to provocation
of emotional reaction.</p>

<p>“What I like in reading a story,” Mrs. Pulver says,
“is a simple gracious English, a shade whimsical perhaps,
that concerns itself with a situation and people
who palpitate, in whose fate you become sincerely interested,
as humans, not merely a clever bit of literary
bridge. And the whole must be laced for me with a
dash of humor, that tender fun-poking that will save
the written human appeal from being heart-throb stuff
or the handiwork of a sob-sister.”</p>

<p>Some examples of contrast have already been offered.
Point out others, even stronger.</p>

<p>In Division II (pages 421-425) the focus is on Nat,
the action seemingly held up, meanwhile. Did you, in
reading, feel this long delay to be irksome, or were you
compensated by the matter itself and the vision of its
promise?</p>

<p>In Division IV, what intensifying value has the rain?</p>

<p>In Division V, what intensifying value has the first
sentence?—“It was dusk when Maw came back; dusk of
a clear day, with a rosy sunset off behind the hills.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General.</span> Mary Brecht Pulver declares she is afraid
she is that “hooted-at and disbelieved-in thing,” an inspirational
writer. “Given a major premise, an argument,
some slight flash of idea, for a chart and I am
ready to sail over the smooth white main. My crew will
come to me ready named, ready behavioured, and will
navigate my bark for me.... All of my stories are
pictures. They unroll like a cinema in colors just off
my left shoulder. They move so fast my wrist aches
to keep up with them. I never rewrite anything unless
an editor requests it. My first draft is the only one.
As you see, this is not intellectual but emotional work.
I can do only a thousand words at a sitting because of
the emotional strain. This seems deplorable, considering
the product but it seems necessary. Like the Jap
in the legend, I must mix a little blood with my clay
to get any kind of pottery.”</p>

<p>At first, this passage would seem to say, “There’s no
use trying to learn to write.” And it may be urged here
that the young fiction aspirant who feels <i>impelled</i> to
create, and according to his own bent, should give his
genius a full chance. Any student may glean this, however,
from the words of Mrs. Pulver: Without emotion
of one’s own, success is impossible.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> “Somewhere I read in the summer
of 1917 a reference to a legend of either a poor saint living
as a hermit or a holy abbess (I can’t really remember
which) who entertained a company of horsemen one
night. In the morning the field where the horses had
grazed was untouched and the realization came that a
troop of angels had been that way. I am sorry not to be
more definite as to this source.</p>

<p>“Washington and the war are wholly of my own invention,
and the miracle of the meadow grass became incidental
as I wrote the story, which I had at first planned
to call ‘The Green Meadow.’ As to the actual processes
of invention I should say no one can quite explain the
least important of them.”—<i>Harrison Rhodes.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> On concluding “Extra Men” if a
reader asks, “What is its purpose?” he will reply in substance,
to his self-query: “To convey the thought that
spirits of our heroic dead support the boys at the front.”
Theme is dominant. “I cannot say that I believe in the
supernatural or miracles,” Mr. Rhodes states, “but I
believe the story of ‘Extra Men’ to be essentially and
symbolically true.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Plot sinks, therefore, into comparative insignificance.
A single incident serves to convey the truth.
Whereas the miracle of the meadow grass might have
been the chief event, its purpose here is rather that of a
detail, substantiating the visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> The spirit of George Washington is the
main character of the incident. Since, however, it is
fitting that the past be subordinated to the present (in
conformity with the author’s purpose), the old lady is
introduced previous to the story-action, and is, therefore,
the main figure of the entire narrative.</p>

<p>Notice the suggestive method used in identifying the
spirit of Washington—nowhere is he openly named.
For example, he speaks of Arlington, “the house which
once belonged to a relative of mine”; and says elsewhere,
“You would not now know Valley Forge.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Buchan was favored with the visit not by accident.
The motivation for it is unobtrusively and perhaps
even unconsciously conveyed, but none the less with
potence. How has the author enlisted sympathy for
her.</p>

<p>What is the rôle of young Buchan? Is there a reason
for his name—“George”?</p>

<p>What plot value has Al Fenton, “the farmer”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> The scene is important, since nowhere else
could the action have occurred with equal fitness. “The
quaint name” of the hamlet at once calls up the historic
episode of Washington crossing the Delaware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere.</span> The realistic mood of the story contributes
to its power of conviction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WAITING_YEARS">THE WAITING YEARS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> This short-story illustrates grouping
for sake of climactic effect. Events of forty years
are illuminated by the happenings of a day. The narrative
has both an outer and an inner action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The plot of the combined inner and outer
story is quite simple. The <i>initial impulse</i> consists of
Mark Faraday’s interest in Miss Allison Clyde. The
<i>dramatic climax</i>, if such it may be called, lies in the finding
of the love-letters which his Uncle William had
written and never sent to Allison. The <i>climax of action</i>
is his handing the package of letters to Allison.</p>

<p>The inner plot is found in the letters. The <i>initial impulse</i>
of William’s love for Allison operates until the
<i>dramatic climax</i>. This dramatic climax is William’s
knowledge that he must die and his feeling that he must
never speak again to Allison of his passion. Up to the
<i>climax of action</i> (his death) his letters have the note
of renunciation; before the dramatic climax they looked
to union with the girl he adored.</p>

<p>The two parts are linked in William’s giving the package
to Allison. Would you have been satisfied to see
him read them without passing them on to her? Are
you satisfied to construct your own dénouement—Allison’s
emotion, etc.?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Since development or deterioration
of character is difficult to indicate within the compass
of the short-story, this specimen shows a distinct
advantage in massing the incidents near the climax. For
Allison may be shown finished, perfect,—the lovely
“personage,” to quote the oracle, Mrs. Herrick,—whom
Mark finds. At the same time, her development is made
logical by the emphasis on her youthful beauty of mind
and heart as her lover saw it. Study, in the usual way,
the many methods by which Mrs. Roof has made vivid
her portrait. Mark’s point of view regarding her is
particularly good; also, the foil, Stella, serves adequately
to set her off. Observe, too, the relation she bears to
her setting, her fitness for it.</p>

<p>Since Mark is the one through whom the reader learns
the facts of the action, his mind is open to the reader’s
vision. Is there too much of the artist about him, not
enough of the man? Would you have him different?
Is he the nephew of his uncle, from a consideration of
sentiment?</p>

<p>What effect is produced by the names, in connection
with their owners?—Mark, Stella, Allison, William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> What is the intensifying worth of the sundial?
Of the buzzing bee? A second line of interest
may be said to lie in the music theme, which intensifies
the line of the love interest and Mark’s interest in Miss
Allison.</p>

<p>Do you feel jarred or pleased by the shift to Allison’s
angle (in her letter, page 204)?</p>

<p>Does Mark too easily come across the daguerreotype,
or does the casual manner of his finding it fit into the
smooth and leisurely progress of the story?</p>

<p>Why is the picture of Allison “standing by the tall
mantle in the candle-light” one that lingers? Why does
one remember the picture of Beatrix (in “Henry Esmond”)
coming down the stairs in white, with cherry

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ZELIG">ZELIG</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> “Zelig” is a character story, with
decided emphasis on the character. There is just enough
plot to lift it from the realm of the sketch into that of
the narrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The <i>struggle</i> lies in Zelig’s attempt to save
sufficient money for returning to Russia. It is unsuccessful.</p>

<p>What is the <i>initial impulse</i>, the first hint of a story
motive?</p>

<p>The dramatic climax is preceded by a minor one:
the death of Zelig’s son. The real turning point, the
<i>dramatic climax</i>, is made up of the wife’s statements
(page 224), the most important of which is the reference
to the son’s death.</p>

<p>The <i>climax of action</i> and the <i>dénouement</i> fall together
in the final speech of the story, being suggested rather
than stated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The old man is characterized by
the author’s description (the direct method, so called);
by the summary of what his brethren felt and said (combination
of direct and indirect methods); by the opinion
his fellow-workmen held of him; and by Zelig’s own acts
and speeches in addition to his habitual manner. Has
he the greater part of the stage for most of the time?
Purpose of his wife? Son? Grandson? Of the background
characters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> “New York’s East Side.” The second
value of the story lies in the setting. Indeed, the character
value would be lost without it, and the unification
is therefore noteworthy. Is the setting made contributory
to atmosphere, also?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> Are you satisfied with the ending? Is the
sense of tragedy at the failure of the human element
striving against circumstance relieved by the recognition
of Zelig’s rehabilitation, or revivification? Has he, in
a deeper sense, conquered in that he has conquered self?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Methods.</span> That Benjamin Rosenblatt creates
his characters, not “lifting” them from life, is manifest
in his statement: “As to Zelig, I really haven’t met
any one just like him, so that I couldn’t have had any
individual case before my mind’s eye when I wrote the
story.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MENORAH">THE MENORAH</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> “A few years ago I passed one of
the congested East Side streets just when a fire broke
out in one of the tenements. I saw climbing down the
fire escapes of the burning building a very old Jewess
dragging some of her belongings with her. Among these
belongings was a pair of old-fashioned, common-place
candlesticks used for ‘Sabbath blessing.’ That started
me on the way to ‘The Menorah.’”—<i>Benjamin Rosenblatt.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> “The Menorah” offers itself as a fit
companion-piece to “Zelig.” In the latter, the setting is
New York, the character is an old man, the struggle is
successfully unsuccessful. In this, the setting is “a little
town in Russia,” the chief character is an old woman,
the struggle is successfully unsuccessful. It is to be
remarked that the two settings are equally well-known
to Mr. Rosenblatt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The <i>struggle</i> is on Lea’s part to preserve appearances
in her rapidly deteriorating circumstances,
to find a match for her daughter, and to keep the Menorah.
The last is the most important. Although she
fails, she does so in a way to relieve the reader’s distress
at her failing.</p>

<p>A <i>minor climax</i> is in the death of the younger girl.</p>

<p>The <i>dramatic climax</i> is the securing of the proper
young man as bridegroom for her daughter.</p>

<p>With the dramatic climax is bound up the <i>climax of
action</i> (of the largest struggle): the Menorah must be
sold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The story is told, as was “Zelig,”
from the omniscient author’s point of view with the
omniscience exercised over the chief character. Study
the portrayal of Lea, as you were recommended to study
that of Zelig. What is the purpose of Reb Schloime?
Compare him with “Paw” Haynes in “The Path of
Glory” as to his function.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> These two stories by Benjamin Rosenblatt
perform a service for the Jewish people, in rationalizing
the desire for money, a desire about which volumes have
been written. It is to be observed in these narratives
that the possession of worldly treasure in each case is
secondary to another ideal. In Lea’s case it is her love
for her ancestors and their glory joined to a sensitiveness
at the fall in her worldly station. What is the primary
ideal in “Zelig”?</p>

<p>What clue to the disposal of the candelabrum occurs
earlier in the narrative?</p>

<p>What national and racial customs intensify the setting?</p>

<p>“To me, a narrative that has for its aim to interest the
reader in its plot is an anecdote, be its plot ever so thick.
A narrative that aims to interest the reader in a slice of
palpitating life—the joys or sorrows of people—be its
plot ever so thin, I call it a short story.”—<i>Benjamin
Rosenblatt.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> This work, and the following one,
“Penance” might be characterized as stories that
are short, rather than short-stories. If the point were
argued, however, it might be said that because of the
situation, the theme quality, and the historic interest, all
of which contribute to unity of effect, the two are outlying
specimens of the <i>genre</i>. The time of the action,
here, is forty years. So it is in “The Waiting Years”
(Page 172), but whereas there the time of the action
is only twenty-four hours (see the management) here it
is the full forty.</p>

Here the elements all work toward unity of effect:

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> This is one of a series of stories centering
around the life of Ferdinand Taillandy, a lovable
hero akin to William J. Locke’s “Beloved Vagabond”
and “Aristide Pujol.” In such a series it is not necessary
or even desirable that the short-story type be sought.
All the narratives, from start to finish, as a complete
series, are more likely to reveal a general structure culminating
in a climax (which will probably require a
whole story) than any one of them is likely to possess
definite and clear-cut mechanism.</p>

<p>The three necessary stages of narrative, according to
Aristotle, are beginning, middle and end. These stages,
as to action, are well-defined in the present story. But
one feels at the beginning that here is a hero brought
over from a preceding adventure, as one knows at the
end that he is off for new experiences. Is the action in
regard to Diane complete?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Taillandy meets Diane. No
particular struggle is initiated, however. Taillandy
merely takes Diane under his protection, here in
Paris, and after some days leaves with her in a two-wheeled
cart.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Diane is restored to her
mother; Taillandy again becomes a wanderer.</p>

<p><i>Body of Story</i>: Among the chief points of interest
are Taillandy’s reversion to the <i>boulevardier</i>
type, and his writing the poem inspired by Diane.
Mention others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> For what reasons do you like
Taillandy? Wherein lies the significance of “Feet of
Gold”? Read the final story in this series, “At the
End of the Road,” and observe whether the author has
kept Taillandy’s character consistent. Take note of the
characters who know Taillandy in the present narrative,
observe the feeling each has for him, and see how well
Mr. Smith has used their opinions to emphasize Taillandy’s
character as described. What does Taillandy
think of each of the other characters?</p>

<p>By what means has the author chiefly pictured Diane?
How has she been enhanced by the two settings? What

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOLITAIRE">SOLITAIRE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> “You ask about the origin of ‘Solitaire,’
which chances to be rather easier to trace than the
origin of most of the stories I have written, since I more
often begin with an abstract ‘idea’ and work outward
to character and plot. When a story begins otherwise I
have discovered (and all such things are matters of discovery
after the fact, and never of premeditation) that it
is almost invariably the result of some purely <i>visual</i> impression
of a single person, detached from any incident or
complication. A stranger, seen once, who recurs again
and again to my mind, and about whom my curiosity increases,
I have learned to rely upon, in a kind of occult
unstatable way, to bring home his own plot.</p>

<p>“The opening scene of ‘Solitaire’ is an exact transcript
of one of those visual impressions. I did see the
man who afterward became ‘Corey’ in the restaurant of
a small Paris hotel. My vis-à-vis did say, ‘Look at the
American!’ and I did turn to meet the twinkle I have
described in the story. The curious thing is that I cannot
now remember whether he wore a decorative ribbon
or not. My impression is that he did not, for it was not
until several weeks later that the idea of decorations as a
‘motive’ occurred to me. What mattered, what really
roused my curiosity, was my <i>surprise</i> at seeing him there,
when I knew nothing at all about the man,—my immediate
sense of his playing a strange rôle, of his being away
from home. He <i>was</i> a physician, he had been working in
the Balkans, and he was going back again the next day.
Also he had been in Russia. These things he told me
after dinner in the salon, when we talked together; and
he was from the Middle West, and called it ‘God’s
country’ and said he wanted to get back. I did not see
him after that night, but he kept coming into my mind,
and each time I would wonder how he had ever come into
my mind, and each time I would wonder how he had ever
come to leave his home in the Middle West, and in the end
it became, I suppose, a kind of subconscious abstract problem.
At any rate the solution appeared one day—and
all I had then to do was to write the story. So, after all,
it was a story of ‘idea’ worked out to plot,—but a visual
impression put the idea into my head. One thing only,
I believe, I knew all the time,—that whatever his motive
was, he was as much in the dark about it as I. That, perhaps,
was what attracted me, what kept my curiosity alive,
and what, in the end, made it an acceptable story.”—<i>Fleta
Campbell Springer.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> Unsheathed from the tissue of its presentation,
the essential plot of this character story is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: Dr. Jim Corey, of Dubuque,
Iowa, happening to be in China at the time of the
Boxer Rebellion wins, by his medical skill, the Japanese
Order of the Rising Sun, and the French ribbon
of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Corey returns
to his home, simple and unaffected. Afterward,
though always off to one of the far corners of
the earth, he comes back with the same indifference
to his decorations. Once or twice only he displays
them, in a spirit of comic masquerade or to please his
friends. In 1912 he takes part in the Balkan campaign,
and happens to meet in Paris, where he goes
for anaesthetics, the <i>narrator</i> of the present story.
(Not the <i>author</i>, it will be noticed.) On his return
to Dubuque in the spring of 1913 he marries. Essentially
a home man and now settled down, he seemingly
feels no inclination at the outbreak of the
World War to get to France. In August, 1915, however,
he goes to Philadelphia, where he supposedly
remains for two months, conducting experiments.
In reality, he sails for France, goes to the front, and
in six weeks wins the Croix de Guerre. He returns
home, as if from Philadelphia.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: After some weeks his wife
finding the Croix de Guerre and learning the truth,
accuses him of being unable to resist a new decoration.
Corey’s faith in himself and the honesty of his
past is destroyed.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward Climax of Action</i>: Corey, in distress,
makes a confessor of his relative, Mr. Ewing.
He seems convinced that he is “rotten” and has been,
without knowing it. Shortly, he leaves again, and
it is given out that he has gone to France to help in
the war. At the front he exposes himself to every
danger; meantime, on duty and off he wears his
array of decorations. It is noteworthy that nobody
sees anything “funny” in them, however. Volunteering
to rescue a wounded officer, he is mortally
injured, and the two are brought to the relief station
together.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action Scene</i>: The officer, while
Corey is unconscious, tells how Corey shielded him
at the expense of his own life. He manages to
despatch a note to General Headquarters. Corey
regains consciousness and calls for his friend Burke,
to whom he dictates Mr. Ewing’s name and address.
Burke, hearing that the Medaille Militaire is to be
conferred upon Corey, tells him. Corey hearing that
three hours will be required remarks, “That’s time
enough.” He desires Mr. Ewing to know that “It
breaks a man’s luck to know what he wants,” and
that he did not take the hypodermic which would
have kept him alive until the conferring of the
Medaille Militaire. He wishes his wife to hear nothing
about the honor he might have had at the last.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: The Division General arrives too
late to confer the medal. Corey had saved his wife
this added disgrace.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The facts of the plot, extending over
a long time, are unified through the device of the narrator
who, first becoming curious about Corey and enlisting
the reader’s curiosity, learns them from Mr. Ewing.
Ewing, then, becomes an inner narrator, and his
story, in turn, encloses that of Burke. The skill of the
author is manifest in the process by which she has so
interwoven the various pieces of information about Corey
as to make a smooth and perfectly joined story. The
element of Chance plays a strong part, but so natural a
rôle that it meets with no lack of credulity. That is,
Chance caused the first meeting, but since in that <i>contretemps</i>
lies the base of the story, it is accepted. Chance
also causes the meeting between the narrator and the only
man, perhaps, who could have given the facts about
Corey’s career. But it is naturally brought about,
through the setting and the preliminaries antecedent to
the recognition that here was some one who knew Corey.</p>

<p>Do you anywhere feel that the narrator is a woman?
Is the narrator’s delicacy in the smoking car, for example,
greater than a man would have felt? Would a man
apologize for hearing the story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Character.</span> The story exemplifies to an unusual degree
the unity which results from emphasizing one character.
Every other is ancillary to Corey. Even his wife
is but a human means for bringing home to his own consciousness
the question as to his motives. The others
exist mainly as links between the reader and Corey.
The interest in the physician, for the reader, lies in
speculating over his acts, his whereabouts, and the opposing
forces of his nature. In the end, it is seen that
he has been all along a single-hearted American, one who
followed his nature, but who, when his attention was
drawn to the sort of nature it appeared to be, determined
upon a course of punishment. The title of the story
strengthens this interpretation. The summary episode
of the Western miner strengthens it: if the miner cheated
at solitaire he shot himself. Corey felt that he had
cheated unaware and set himself to the task of flagellation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> The contrast between the Middle West and
France emphasizes the apparent contradictory qualities in
Corey’s nature. The shift in settings is in itself conducive
to unity and short-story effect only through contrast;
but the rehearsed method of telling the story, with
the accent on Corey, properly subordinates the divergence
in locality and swings it into harmony.</p>

<p>Fleta Campbell Springer thinks a short-story is whatever
the author makes it. “That is why I believe in it,
in its possibilities. The very fact that you can’t put your
finger on it, can’t ticket it, or define it, is its fascination.
Its limits are the limits of the author’s ability, and there
are several kinds of authors in the world. The word
‘short-story’ is sufficient definition in itself, length being
the only quality to come under restriction.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_YELLOW_CAT">THE YELLOW CAT</h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Steele’s twelve or fifteen years of studying the
technique of story writing have resulted in his mastering
the power of suggestion, found at its height in Kipling,
and the clear vigorous expression for which Stevenson
is famous. Without a statement to the contrary
from the author himself it would be safe to assume that
they were his models.</p>

<p>“The Yellow Cat” is told in the first person by
Ridgeway, aided by McCord, and it is in part created
by the reader. One who likes to create with ease will
find a strain upon his powers of construction; the more
he takes his reading as a narcotic, the less he will enjoy
it. The constructive reader will delight in it.</p>

<p>As a change from the analysis of plot in the presentation,
it will be profitable to construct the events in chronological
order.</p>

<p>A. The master of the <i>Abbie Rose</i> fears his Chinaman
cook; he enters his fear in his log, intimating that he
may do away with the Chinaman.</p>

<p>B. The second seaman, Bach, also becomes a victim of
fear. The two men find that their revolvers are stolen.</p>

<p>C. (Invented by every reader to suit himself. Perhaps
the two seamen deserted the ship?)</p>

<p>D. The Chinaman is left on board. (Is he innocent?)
He climbs into the shrouds, when he sees the smoke of
an approaching vessel.</p>

<p>E. The vessel is descried, soon after C, or D, by the
<i>Mercury</i>. (... “the stove in the galley still slightly
warm.”) It is seemingly empty but for a yellow cat.</p>

<p>F. McCord and Björnsen are detailed to steer the
<i>Abbie Rose</i> to port, over a hundred miles distant. McCord
is the engineer.</p>

<p>G. Björnsen, going to shake out the foretopsail encounters
the Chinaman.</p>

<p>H. (Invented by the reader. Björnsen was probably
knocked into the sea, and may have made his escape to the
land. Was he killed?)</p>

<p>I. McCord missing Björnsen, and becoming obsessed
by the yellow cat, begins to consider the theory of transmigration
of souls.</p>

<p>J. (Suggested to the reader: McCord thinking the
Chinaman is dead—for he has read the log entries—suspects
that his soul has come back in the body of the
cat.)</p>

<p>K. He undergoes a period of mental agony, during
which time he brings the vessel into port. He sees the
shadow of the Chinaman; he shoots at the shadow; he
misses the water, etc. He cannot sleep and the cat has
disappeared.</p>

<p>(Note that all the incidents above are of the time
preceding the “acting time” of the story, or the immediate
situation and action.)</p>

<p>L. The narrator, Ridgeway, here comes on board the
vessel lying in the upper river.</p>

<p>M. As the men talk, McCord relating his experiences,
the cat re-appears.</p>

<p>N. She hears a sound, rushes amidships, and the men
follow.</p>

<p>O. They look aloft. (See page 255, top.)</p>

<p>P. (Suggested: McCord sees something in the shroud.)</p>

<p>Q. (Suggested: He shakes down the Chinaman.)</p>

<p>R. The Chinaman escapes, leaving his slipper.</p>

<p>S. McCord from the mast brings down the two revolvers
and other things.</p>

<p>T. McCord now understands the whole business; he
goes to sleep at once.</p>

<p>Such an order would have spoiled the story. Notice
in the presentation:</p>

<p>1. The gathering up of the greater part of the incidents
at the shortest possible distance from the climax of
action.</p>

<p>2. The economical and dramatic method by which the
preceding circumstances are set forth. The reader knows
only what McCord knows.</p>

<p>3. The large employment of suggestion.</p>

<p>4. The keeping of the place—the boat is the scene of
action for three different groups, only the last group being
the immediate actors.</p>

<p>5. The excellent clues to the shrouds as the hiding
place. (See pages 237, ... “top-sails being pursed up
... but not stowed”; 238, ... “handing down like huge,
over-ripe pears,” etc.)</p>

<p>6. The logic of McCord’s not finding the hiding place
of the cook. (First sentence, page 255.) This illustrates
Poe’s theory as set forth in “The Purloined Letter.”</p>

<p>7. The use of suspense. The reader wonders whether
the explanation will lie in the supernatural or the natural.
Suspense is satisfied only in the dénouement, after which

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The story is told in reminiscent vein
by one who uses his own angle as a boy. It recalls the
manner of “Treasure Island,” as “The Yellow Cat”
recalls Kipling. The boy’s angle is faithfully kept, with
excellent results. The first value of the boy’s angle is
that much of the action was unclear to him, as it
progressed chronologically, and this obscurity is carried
over to the reader. The reader, then, is kept in suspense,
as the boy was, until the outcome. It is a well-known
and capital means of creating and heightening
suspense. The second value is that the boy’s point of
view is the best for unity of effect. Observe that this is
true in studying the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: Malden marries Sympathy
Gibbs, whom Mate Snow has been considering for
himself. This incident motivates the chain of events
that follow.</p>

<p>(The following is revealed out of chronological
order, as the plot is <i>presented</i>. But as effect resulting
from cause it follows, in the plot <i>construction</i>,
the initial incident):</p>

<p><i>First Steps toward Dramatic Climax</i>: Mate
Snow writes in the name of Gibbs, to Minister
Malden, saying he is alive. “Gibbs” demands
money as a reward for his silence and non-appearance.
Malden, unable to bear the thought of his
child being a bastard, meets the demand. He further
agrees to stay away from his wife and child.
(Do you think the motivation is strong enough, under
the given conditions, to make the Minister do
this?) Sam Kow, a Chinaman sees the exchange
of letter and money.</p>

<p><i>Next Steps</i>: (These are revealed at first reading,
but cause wonder and suspense, as the <i>preceding</i>
steps are unknown to the boy and to the reader):</p>

<p>Malden leaves Sympathy and his baby and lives
with Mate Snow, occupying two rooms over the
drug store.</p>

<p>The village wonders but Mate Snow seemingly
takes the part of Malden. Nobody, of course, suspects
his villainy.</p>

<p>The Minister tries to “convert” Yen Sin, the
Chinaman, and motivation for this struggle goes
back to the antecedent period (first paragraphs)
when the minister had voyaged to heathen shores
to work in “the field.” (Notice the reason given
for his return, and observe that the earthly and
divine loves were even then at odds in his make-up.)</p>

<p><i>Step in Chronological Order</i> (but held back until
the outcome): Yen Sin receives collars from Sam
Kow on which Sam informs him of the exchange
of letters and money. This correspondence keeps
up for seven years.</p>

<p><i>Further Steps</i>: Yen Sin keeps his own reserve
and his own religion.</p>

<p>One evening Minister Malden fails to show up at
prayer-meeting. Mate Snow presides. The boy
creeps off to the pillar-house, where Sympathy lives.
He sees</p>

<p>1. That Minister Malden enters. 2. That Yen
Sin also sees. The boy makes a visit of a month.
He returns to find Mate Snow the big man of the
village. Yen Sin has grown older and feebler.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: Yen Sin is dying: he asks for
the Minister. (It is from the Chinaman’s death that
the change of Malden’s fortunes arises.)</p>

<p>Steps following immediately, and leading directly
to climax of action.—The boy enters the church to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
see Snow in the pulpit; he stammers out the Chinaman’s
need for the Minister. Snow answers the
call. The boy hates Snow; he continues to look for
Malden. He goes to the pillar-house. He looks
beneath a drawn shade and sees Malden receiving
five hundred dollars from Sympathy; he hears her
<a id="say"></a>say, “It brings us to the end, Will.” He hears the
Minister thanking God it’s Mate Snow who holds
the mortgage. But Sympathy declares that Mate
has “sucked the life” out of Malden. The boy
screams out that the Chinaman is dying. Then he
rushes off to the scow of Yen Sin. Now follows the
struggle of wills, and of races; Chinaman is pitted
against American, in the</p>

<p><i>Impulse of Final Suspense</i>: The boy hears Snow
enjoining the Chinaman to confess. Yen Sin calls
for his collars, and as they lie curling about him, he
mildly asks for Snow’s confession. Snow finally
confesses, “I have coveted my neighbor’s wife.”
Here Malden enters. He reveals that Gibbs is alive,
and to save his child, he has paid hush-money. (See
above.) He has promised to stay away from wife
and child, but has gone to them in secret. This is
his confession. Then Yen Sin reveals what Sam
Kow has written from Infield—on the collars—Malden
has paid money.... Here Snow goes mad,
fearing exposure, and blurts out enough to show it
is he who has demanded the money. Yen Sin points
out that at any time “Mista God” would have accepted
confession, “makee allee light.” Minister
Malden begins to comprehend.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Snow drinks poison; he dies.
The villagers rush him off to the doctor’s. The boy
and Malden are alone with Yen Sin. Malden runs
to fetch his wife and child. Yen Sin sends the boy
for the minister. Yen Sin’s departure, “China
way,” and Malden’s prayer for his soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theme.</span> The story is thought-provoking in its bigness
of theme which every reader will express for himself.
Many will see no further than the concrete events.
Others may be tempted, perhaps, to read more into the

not the transactions at Infield? Give two reasons, one
with regard to unity, the other with regard to handling
of plot.</p>

<p>Is there reason that the action might have strayed over
too much time and place for the purpose of the short-story?

of Snow from <i>poison</i> become so logical as scarce to

<p>“Tubbed box trees,” “the big green door,” “lilac

pray alone.” Clue to what? Do you think it credible
that Mate Snow never suspected where Malden went on
these occasions? If he knew, what motive kept him
silent? Where did Mate Snow suppose the Minister got
the hush-money?</p>

<p>Page 449—“The door was still open, a blank, bright
rectangle giving into the deserted vestry, and it was
against this mat of light that I spied Minister Malden’s
head,” etc. What processes work to make this a memorable
bit of description. Point out similar examples in
this story and in the other stories of Mr. Steele. Point
out examples in stories by other authors.</p>

<p>Study Mr. Steele’s use of shadows, here and in “The
Yellow Cat.” Compare them with Mr. Dobie’s shadows
in “Laughter.” The value of shadows lies in their suggestion.
They call up the real thing in fiction more easily
and economically than the thing itself, as described, can
do. The reason is obvious. If there is a shadow, the
reader knows, unconsciously, there must be something
to cast it. Hence, curiosity may be aroused; in any
event, “belief” is secured in the reality of the object.</p>

<p>“Approaching ... I put one large, round eye to the
aperture.” (Page 455.) Did the boy think of himself
as having a “large round eye”? Or does the narrator
think of himself (now a man of years) as he looked?
Is it sound technique, either way regarded, or would it
be better to leave out the “large, round”?</p>

<p>Is it more fascinating to read of something viewed
in part and surreptitiously than it is to read of the same
scene viewed as a whole and freely under usual conditions?
What primitive impulses are appealed to?</p>

<p>Page 457, in the paragraph beginning, “I shall never

what excellent bit of description occurs?</p>

<p>What do you think of the idea “—the emotion of
humor, which is another name for perception”? (Page
458.)</p>

<p>Page 459, in the paragraph beginning, “Yes,” he murmured,
is an excellent example of irony. How does it
aid the action?</p>

<p>Do you believe that in the struggle of wills Mate Snow
would have given in to the urge of the Chinaman? What
circumstances argue for the result? What is against it?</p>

<p>Page 465. Do not fail to take the full meaning of
the paragraph to heart: “He lay so still over there on
the couch.” In what lines is the thought most poignant?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DARK_HOUR">THE DARK HOUR</h2>
</div>


<p>“The Dark Hour” has, in the story sense, no plot.
The only action lies in a fragmentary discussion between
the sick man, Hallett, and his physician who paces the
deck of the homeward bound vessel. The only hint of a
struggle lies in the conflicting viewpoints of the two men.</p>

<p>Hallett holds that Germany has a vision—“a red,
bloody, damned vision”—but a vision. The Allies have,
as yet, no vision.</p>

<p>The doctor argues that the Allies <i>want to win the war</i>.</p>

<p>Hallett replies that this desire is nightmare.—“The
only thing to beat a vision black as midnight is a vision
white as the noonday sun.” He eventually gives the possible
vision,—symbolized earlier by his words, “There’s
a bright star, doctor,”—in the thin-worn word, “Democracy.”
He declares that such an impossible Utopia must
come—or “Hamburg to Bagdad.” As the doctor declares
that this wild <a id="empire"></a>empire of the spirit is impossible and
Hallett agrees, cryptically, that it is impossible, the watch
cries “All’s well.” Hallett then says we may do the
impossible, after all; in all the world is nothing but the
sound of the barricades of revolution. He sees the star,
as he has seen it in the beginning of the dialogue.</p>

<p>The argument thus becomes an optimistic prophecy of
the final vision of the Allies. At Thanksgiving, 1918, the
impossible seems about to be realized: Hallett was essentially
right, in his point of view.</p>

<p>The sick man, one who probably dying is assumedly
close to the spirit-world, is well-balanced by the material
physician, representing the earth-spirit.</p>

<p>Besides suggesting a nexus between America and the
fighting Allies, the homeward bound vessel affords from
its deck, quite naturally, the view of the star, which becomes
symbolically useful; and, further, the cry of the
watch, “All’s well,” which also conveys a deeper meaning.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> In “The Bird of Serbia,” Mr.
Street desired to say through the medium of fiction a
certain thing. “Perhaps I wanted to say: ‘Nothing
is so small or so nasty that it can not be made to serve an
autocratic ruler in carrying out his designs.’ So, then, I
took as my symbol for smallness and nastiness, the louse.
And then I set out to prove that lice could serve the autocrat
who wished to start a war. I wanted to show how
very true that theory is, and I should say that the quality
of truth in that story—the convincingness of it—is the
best thing about it.”—<i>Julian Street.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulses</i>, giving rise to the struggle and the
complication.—</p>

<p>Gavrilo Prinzip, a subject of Austro-Hungary, living
in Sarajevo, Bosnia, is a Serb by descent and
nature. The revolutionary spirit he displays at an
early age gives evidence of his passionate racial feeling.
In 1913, at the age of eighteen, he is betrothed
to Mara. The two are devoted to each other, but
Mara resents Gavrilo’s constant ideal of a free Serb
race. She is, perhaps, “jealous of a people.”</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Sarajevo
plans to have on June 28, Kossovo Day, a celebration
greater than usual because of Serbian independence
gained in the two preceding years of the
Balkan War. A few days before, Mara’s relative,
a former supposed rival of Gavrilo, gives her a
black song bird—a <i>kos</i>. Gavrilo begs her to release
the bird. She feels that she will be giving up
her own character to free it, and persists in keeping
it caged. She is confirmed in her stubbornness
through the advice of her relative. The Serbian
festival is forbidden; attempts to commemorate the
anniversary will result in arrest. Austrian manoeuvres
will take place, instead. The Archduke will appear,
in spite of advice to the contrary. It is clear
that a plot is brewing. Gavrilo has promised, however,
not to participate in anything violent so long
as Mara loves him. She assures him of her love,
whereupon he asks her again, to set the <i>kos</i> free.</p>

<p><i>Minor Climax</i>: She refuses. The <i>kos</i> has become
a symbol for both. Mara in releasing it
would surrender her will power; Gavrilo releasing
it would see an emblem of freedom for all Serbs.</p>

<p>Gavrilo engages in the plot, but remembering his
promise he refuses to “participate in certain matters.”
He and Mara are happy so long as the bird
is not mentioned. When he puts leaves into the
cage, however, Mara begs him not to do so; she
fears they are poisonous, as the bird is growing
weaker. Gavrilo insists that captivity is killing it.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: On the evening of June 27,
the bird dies. “It was not a dead bird that I saw,
but a climax in a parable.”</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: Gavrilo and
Mara, filled with emotion, dispute over the cause of
death. Mara insists that the bird man must determine
the cause, and affects to believe that Gavrilo
has poisoned it. He runs from the garden, frantic.
The bird man comes; he points out the lice. Mara
sends for Gavrilo. He cannot be found. The Archduke,
his wife, and their suite arrive.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: On the morning of June 28,
Gavrilo shoots the Archduke and the Archduchess
as they ride through the streets of Sarajevo.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Gavrilo dies, four years later, in
prison.</p>
</div>

<p>The struggle, then, is one of wills—Gavrilo’s against
Mara’s. The two lines of interest forming the complication
are 1st, the love story of Gavrilo and Mara; 2nd, the
relations between Serbians and Austria. This complication
begins with the initial impulse of the story and finds
its solution only with the climax of action.</p>

<p>Examples of good craftsmanship in details are 1st,
making Gavrilo a good shot, and at the same time introducing
the bird <i>motif</i>; 2nd, strengthening Mara’s will
and antagonizing Gavrilo by the cousin, who is introduced
with the first mention of Gavrilo’s love affair. Point out
other instances of plot finish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The story, as told by a man in a
smoking-car, is immediately and logically motivated by
the newspaper account of Gavrilo Prinzip’s death. The
dénouement, therefore, is presented first, though it appears
from the conclusion that the narrator’s fellow-travelers
do not recognize this fact until the series of
events comes full circle.</p>

<p>In connection with the plot, notice how the narrator is
bound up with it. What advantages do you find in the
author’s presenting the story in the rehearsed, rather
than in the dramatic way? “In order to show what I
was driving at,” says Mr. Street, “it was necessary for
me to use the form of the inner, related story—a form
which is always awkward, but which sometimes succeeds
in spite of its awkwardness, for the reason that the
reader becomes so absorbed in the inner story that he
forgets that an individual is supposed to be speaking,
and that, too often, that individual is talking like a book,
rather than a human being, let alone an easy raconteur.</p>

<p>“My story, ‘The Bird of Serbia,’ is not without this
fault. The man who sits in the smoking-room of a
Pullman car and relates the inner tale, would not, in
actual life, have spoken altogether as I made him speak.
To that extent, then, the story is imperfect; but this imperfection
is not likely to be noticed by the average reader,
because it is not sufficiently glaring to remind him that
the man in the smoking-room is supposed to be talking all
the while.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> What traits in the chief actors
are most conspicuous? Are they “played up” convincingly
and economically? What value have the background
characters—the mother of Gavrilo, for example?
What points of the Austrian character are noted, because
of which sympathy is diverted from the Archduke?</p>

<p>Is the narrator of Gavrilo’s story, the man in the smoking-car, 
a minor character or a disinterested chronicler of
the events he followed so minutely and accurately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Notice that Mr. Street restrains his narrator
from <i>stating</i> the name of the place, Sarajevo, until
near the conclusion. Does its reserve increase the final
effect? What details indicate the author’s familiarity
with local conditions, customs, dress, and language? To
what end do these local color data contribute?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> What clue do you find in the narrator’s
statement about the “microscopic unclean forces of
which historians will never know”?</p>

<p>Do you regard the ending as one of “surprise”? If
so, is it calculated as such, or rather a chance offshoot of
what was intended, rather, as a strong closing sentence?</p>

<p>On the subject of story writing in general, Mr. Street
makes a valuable observation:</p>

<p>“It seems to me that there is a tendency, in discussing
the art of short story writing, to confuse manner and
matter, and to conclude that the story with a big, sombre
theme must necessarily be superior, as a work of art, to
the story which is lighter in subject and treatment.
When I say ‘light’ I do not mean frivolous or false.
De Maupassant, Leonard Merrick, and O. Henry have
taught us better than that. A story can have the quality
of truth, and can be rich in character and observation,
yet be done with splendid deftness of touch—and oftentimes
this very deftness, which we so seldom see in a
story, is regarded too lightly by critics. It is much as
though we were to insist that the wood-chopper has
greater skill than the tight-rope walker, valuing the heavy
strokes of the one more highly than the poise and adeptness
of the other. A light touch in a story often suggests
that it has been produced with ease; and a light
step on the tight-rope suggests the same thing; but when
we see a man swinging a heavy axe at a huge tree trunk,
breathing hard and sweating, we readily perceive that he
is doing real work. Hard work. I do not dispute that
there may be certain lumber-jacks who handle the two-edged
axe with a practiced skill rivaling or, perhaps, even
surpassing the skill of a fair tight-rope walker; but
neither do I hold with those who see art only where there
is sweat and smell and swearing.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Thorold is the chief figure, emphasized
from beginning to end by the author’s comment,
by his own recollections, by his son’s remarks to him, and
by his own confession. The <i>struggle</i> is Thorold’s.
What aspects has it?</p>

<p>The second figure is Framberg—dead. He is the
<i>cause</i> of the immediate phase of the long struggle, the
climactic phase. He is the contrasting element, the
heroic young man, even an alien by birth, who was nevertheless
a better American than Thorold. (Notice the information
given, page 262, about his foreign birth.)
Through whom does the reader get most of the information
about Isador?</p>

<p>The third figure is Peter, a foil of another sort for
his father. He is the judge. “Our children are always
our ultimate judges”—page 268. Is Peter, at any
point, inconsistent with your concept of a sixteen year
old boy? How do you account for the fact, with respect
to authorship and artistic purpose of the author?
Are his personality and influence, joined to that of Framberg’s,
strong enough for the motivating force? That
is, would Thorold have told his story? Would he have
given up the ambassadorship?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting, Etc.</span> The narrator brings together in an
apparently easy yet powerful way in a tempo suited to
the happenings in real life the forces of half a century.
(Compare with this management that in “The Waiting
Years.”) The action occurs within a single morning.
Chicago is kept before the reader by numerous references.
The magnitude of the narrative is increased by the spirit
of Lincoln; the poignancy of sentiment by the lilac fragrance,
the picture of the hearse, the reminiscence of the
dead Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> How consistently does the author
keep to the mind of Thorold in exercising her power of
omniscience? When she shifts to the boy’s mind, do
you feel a break in the unity? What alleviating circumstances
help to preserve the unity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atmosphere.</span> The tone is restrained, sad from the inner
failure of the man who has known worldly success;
yet it is hopeful in the spiritual outcome of the struggle
and in the promise of the young boy Peter. Is it character
or setting which, in this story, contributes most to
atmosphere?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> A story of situation, suggesting
numerous small struggles. (See below.) It is a remarkable
example of the <i>multum in parvo</i> management
required of the short-story. The action requires a brief
part of one day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span> The <i>impulse</i> of the action lies in the telephone
message announcing Bessie Lowe’s death.</p>

<p>The <i>dramatic climax</i> is in Dick’s perjury: his declaration
that Bessie Lowe was the girl <i>he</i> had cared for.</p>

<p>The <i>climax of action</i> lies in the narrator’s discovery
that Standish—not Dick—had been Bessie’s lover.</p>

<p>The <i>dénouement</i> is the narrator’s “poisoned arrow”
flash of light that Dick had loved Leila and had sacrificed
his own fiancée to the hurt to save Leila’s feelings.
With the recognition dawns the realization that she and
Dick must go their ways.</p>

<p>Struggle moments suggested are: 1. In the heart of
Standish. Shall he confess to his wife? 2. In the heart
of Dick. Shall he sacrifice his fiancée to save Leila’s
feelings? 3. On Leila’s part. Shall she indicate that
she knows Dick is lying? 4. On the part of the narrator.
What shall she do about it? In each case, the outcome
arrives with celerity, and love is the ruling motive in each
struggle. The decision, as affected by love, testifies to
the character of each person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> Is each character so described,
and does he show such action and interaction as to make
logical the behavior in the particular struggle? Must
the reader accept any one of the decisions on faith alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> What is it? Has it particular contributory
value, or might the locale have been, say, New York?
How is it integrated with atmosphere and action? (See,
e.g., page 468, “Through the purpling twilight of that
St. John’s eve.”)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details.</span> How might the narrator have hoodwinked
herself as to Dick’s motive? How might Dick have explained
so as either 1. to satisfy the narrator, or 2. to
leave her—and the reader—in doubt? Which of the
three choices would have been cheapest and easiest?
Which would have destroyed, altogether, the individuality
of the story?</p>

<p>Study the sound effects, beginning in the very first
paragraph; Is there a suggestion of disturbed harmonies,
in a spiritual sense? Notice that the sounds suggest the
entire London background against which the individual
tragedy stands out, etched in a few lines.</p>

<p>What value have the poetic passages which Miss Synon
is fond of introducing into her stories? Do they seem
to be external, or have they been made an essentially
vital part of the whole?</p>

<p>What does lavender, at the close, signify?</p>

<p>Wherein lies the deepest pathos of the story? How is
it conveyed—by notice or neglect or by a happy restraint?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HALF-PAST_TEN">HALF-PAST TEN</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span> As a short-story of situation, this
narrative achieves that concentration found in Barrie’s
“Half Hour” Plays. It may be studied as all the preceding
examples have been studied, but attention is called
to</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skill in Presentation.</span></p>

<p>1. In the suspense, (a) the reader senses a tragedy,
but has not all the details until the end of the first seven
or eight hundred words, (b) the reader waits the news
of Jim’s death.</p>

<p>2. In the new rise of interest after Al’s announcement,
“All over.”</p>

<p>3. In depicting the characters almost wholly through
acts and speeches.</p>

<p>4. In satisfying the reader. Jim died for a crime committed
by another, but he seems to have deserved death
on general principles. Again, the surviving family have
the poor knowledge and consolation that he was immediately
innocent.</p>

<p>5. In the objective method (already suggested under
3) which conveys directly the grim tragedy and sordid
realism.</p>

<p>A slip in the method is found in the fact that the mind
of the child is invaded once or twice. It would seem that
at the beginning the author meant to present the whole
tragedy from the point of view of Rhoda, who would
not comprehend it all, of course, and would therefore
serve a purpose similar to that of the thirteen year old
boy in “Ching, Ching, Chinaman.” But either the task
proved too difficult, or the author changed her purpose,
without the revision which would have given perfection
to the method. (See, <i>e.g.</i>, page 349, “Rhoda took stock
of them....” This illustrates her “angle” or the
author’s exercise of omniscience over her baby mentality.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AT_ISHAMS">AT ISHAM’S</h2>
</div>


<p>Setting and idea overbalance plot and characterization
in this story, which hardly concerns itself with narrative
form. True, it supports—rather than is supported by—an
embryonic plot; and, true, the plot is marked by
a struggle element in the guise of antagonism between two
men. But the author is interested in his question and
in the debate.</p>

<p>The starting point of the argument is this query, propounded
by Norvel, at Isham’s restaurant: “If Mars
is inhabited by a race so similar to ourselves, what means
of communication between us is there so unmistakably
of <i>human origin</i> that a sight of it or a sound from it
would unmistakably convince them of our relationship?”</p>

<p>As suggestion after suggestion is dismissed, it seems to
be clear that nature can imitate everything. Then Savelle
declares that man can only imitate nature. Philbin retorts:
“That’s contrary to every teaching of Christ you
ever raved about.” Philbin goes away. Savelle continues
to maintain that all that is human is imitation.</p>

<p>Then comes the great war. Philbin returns to Isham’s
after five years, in the second of the world conflict. Depressed,
old, and distrait, he announces that he has lost
his son. He produces the bronze cross, bestowed upon
his son for saving the lives of two fishmongers. Young
Philbin was going back for the third when he was killed.</p>

<p>Norvel asks what part of nature Mr. Philbin was then
imitating.</p>

<p>Savelle affirms, “It is the divine phenomenon of
Calvary.” But Philbin replies, “When my son was alive,
he was a man. I believe he, too, died like a man. I
prefer that to an imitation of anything—even God.”</p>

<p>There is, then, no outcome; for the conclusion but
emphasizes, further, the two separate views. A larger
truth is conveyed, however, which as if incidentally
usurps the end to which the story seems headed. It is
this: Sacrifice of life for a weaker brother is either Godlike
or manlike. With this dawning thesis in mind, the
reader recognizes that Mr. Venable has answered emphatically
the question set up in such stories as “Greater
Love—” and “The Knight’s Move.” (See page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.)</p>

<p>Are the views of Philbin and Savelle, in the end, the
same each held at the beginning?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Circumstances Antecedent to the Main Action</i>:
Hazelton, who cannot sell his “blond” canvasses,
paints “La Guigne Noire,” a study in dark. He is
immediately approved by the public. After three
years he has ceased exposing pictures of his earlier
and better manner.</p>

<p><i>Initial Incident</i>: While he is engaged on “Le Mal
du Ventre,” he meets Raoul de Vilmarte, an inferior
artist but gentleman of means. The latter admires
the former work, and insists that Hazelton should
claim his position as the apostle of light. Hazelton
suggests that another signature might bring recognition.
De Vilmarte lightly offers his name.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: He signs a
Hazelton picture, which is immediately accepted and
acclaimed. The two artists decide to keep the secret,
as the best way out of what has become an awkward
situation. Hazelton decides to go on with his
“darker” method. Some months later the two men
make another bargain—De Vilmarte buys a painting
of Hazelton. The traffic continues, whenever
De Vilmarte needs a picture or Hazelton needs
money. (Notice the motivation for the needs.)
Hazelton, having transferred his affection to his
second manner, feels a mad sense of rivalry. On
the occasion of the next exhibition De Vilmarte
wins the second medal. Hazelton has only one
picture on the line. Raoul is sorry; Hazelton says
the thing must stop. But now De Vilmarte’s mother
urges a private exhibition. Hazelton bargains
once more, but with the statement that one of
the four must die—he, his wife, De Vilmarte, or
De Vilmarte’s mother.—“There is death in our little
drama.” De Vilmarte falls in love; his agony increases.
Hazelton paints an unusually fine picture.
Raoul signs it but declares that it is the end; he has
defiled himself too long.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: The supposed artist receives
the Legion of Honor. Mme. de Vilmarte comments
on the resemblance between her son’s “work” and
Hazelton’s, “as though you were two halves of a
whole, a day and night.” Hazelton gives up his
thought of exposing De Vilmarte.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: The struggle
continues; Hazelton, at intervals, threatens De
Vilmarte; the latter plans to kill Hazelton, then himself.
But he decides to wait until his mother dies.
Affairs have reached this state when war breaks
out, and France claims both artists. Hazelton writes
to Raoul that he must not fear for his mother, if he
comes to harm. Both are engaged for some time in
fighting.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: Wounded, they meet in a
hospital. Hazelton learns that De Vilmarte’s right
hand is injured; he dies in an ironic burst of laughter
that Raoul’s luck holds to the end.</p>

<p>The details of plot are presented chronologically,
from the omniscient author’s point of view. Do
you see any value in the author’s exercising omniscience
over the mind of first one character then the
other? Would the story gain if she had invaded
only Raoul’s mind? Hazelton’s?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters.</span> In Hazelton, the dominant character,
Mrs. Vorse presents an interesting study of dual personality.
She gains the reader’s sympathy for him
chiefly by showing that his better nature, as revealed in
his “first manner,” lacked appreciation from the artistic
world. He was, in a measure, forced to rely upon his
“second” or “darker” manner. In this respect the
narrative offers a novel divergence from other stories of
the type. At the same time, the contrasting features in
the man’s physical appearance, in his craftsmanship, and
in his behavior toward De Vilmarte testify to the indubitable
presence of light and shade in his intrinsic
make-up.</p>

<p>De Vilmarte is only a foil, but sufficiently vitalized to
share, proportionately, the reader’s interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span> Nowhere except in France could the development
of events be so easily compassed. From the
salon of the beginning to the hospital at the close, the
setting is an integral part of the story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WHITE_BATTALION">THE WHITE BATTALION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting Point.</span> “It was in those intolerable days of
1917 when Russia had fallen away and America seemed
perilously unready; when German intrigue helped by
treachery behind the allied lines in France, England and
Italy was winning the war for Germany; intolerable to
those of soldier blood whose years put them beyond the
dead line of enlistment requirements and who could do
nothing more than work and earn and give over here.</p>

<p>I was haunted interminably by the suffering of the
women of France whose men had died on the field of
honor—wasted suffering if, in the end, the German won.
I knew the women would fight against any—is there a
stronger adjective of horror now than <i>Germanic</i> odds?
How could these widowed women, or even the dead bear
it—and in a flash “The White Battalion” came.</p>

<p>Always the supernatural stories “flash” in this way,
apparently in answer to a long sub-conscious demand for
justice beyond human power to compass. Other stories
build more or less painfully, save for the big scene.”—<i>Frances
Gilchrist Wood.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Initial Impulse</i>: Widows of certain heroic
Frenchmen, petitioning to be entered and drilled as
the —nth Battalion of Avengers, are accepted and
trained.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Dramatic Climax</i>: Each woman
adds a packet of potassium cyanide to her equipment.
They request, further, to be assigned to the
position which will be in the course of advance to
retake the ground held to the death by their men.
Major Fouquet commands them. Order comes for
the attack, and they go over the top, eagerly, gripping
their bayonets as they follow the barrage across
No Man’s Land. When the barrage lifts the women
see “thrust shield-wise above the heads of the Huns—frightened
and sobbing—hundreds of little children!”
(This is a minor climax.) The women
recognize they must either betray a trust or cut
through the barricade of children. After an instant
only the woman captain makes the sign of
the cross and stumbles forward—on her wrist
bound the packet of death! They will charge, her
followers understand, but the poison will erase the
hideous memory forever. The captain falls....</p>

<p><i>Dramatic Climax</i>: As the women grip to thrust,
there sweeps down a battalion of marching shadows
in a blur of gold and blue that outstrips the advance
of the Avengers. There is a flash of charging steel
and the waving colors of the old —nth as they sweep
over the untouched children into the trench.</p>

<p><i>Steps toward the Climax of Action</i>: The bravest
man in the old —nth bends over the fallen captain;
there is a smile of recognition, then the woman’s
figure springs to his side and sweeps forward with
the Battalion.</p>

<p><i>Climax of Action</i>: The old soldiers of the —nth,
led by “a shining one,” save their women from the
“last hellish trap set by fiends”! The Avengers and
the White Battalion retake the ground for which the
—nth gave their lives.</p>

<p><i>Dénouement</i>: Fouquet and Barres, having seen
the field from different angles, report the episode.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presentation.</span> The rehearsal of this dramatic occurrence,
so shortly after the event, scarcely detracts from
its stirring qualities. So striking are they, in fact, that
presented directly they would probably suffer from over-emphasis
and consequent lack of conviction. Moreover,
reality is conveyed through</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The curiosity of the foreign officers over losing
contact with the French forces;</p>

<p>2. The colloquial way in which the history of the
—nth Battalion is given;</p>

<p>3. The establishing of truth through the mouths of
two witnesses;</p>

<p>4. The emphasis on the forty seconds, which under
the conditions of presentation gains significance;</p>

<p>5. The assurance that the children have been sent
to the rear to be cared for.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characterization.</span> The individual characters of the
main incident are lost in the group—save for the bright
passage about the dead woman captain. Avenging their
dead, righting a wrong, holding sacred a trust, keeping
faith with the Fatherland, dying in performance of duty—of
all these the avenging women were nobly capable.
The <i>struggle</i>, in its relation to woman nature, is one of
the most psychologically true found in fiction. It was
all over in forty seconds; yet the so-called instinct of
woman—in reality her ability to judge and decide
quickly—terminated the struggle between tenderness and
trust, with ample time left over. Faith would be kept,
even at the expense of their mortal bodies and of their
immortal souls.—The characteristic of the White Battalion
is the spirit of protection. The characteristics of
Fouquet and Barres are simplicity, honesty and an almost
homely every-day-heroic quality, all of which work
to the conviction of the reader. Because of the family
relations, the fundamental notions of honor, and elemental
ideals exhibited, this story is destined to last.
Founded on bed-rock principles of life itself, it towers
into the realm of spirit.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“The short-story is, of course, the recountal of some
struggle or complication so artistically told as to leave
upon the reader one dominant impression. Perhaps the
‘artistic’ is redundant, for can a story leave such an
impression unless it be artistically told? Even geniuses
must master their vehicle of expression or remain dumb.
To win the sought for reaction to a short-story, painting,
play or oratorio, one learns either in the hard, blind school
of ‘rejection slips’ or by the intelligent method of skilled
critic and master, but learn one must.</p>

<p>“The high water mark in story writing is reached most
often for me by the dramatic story, objectively told. It
is the genius who selects just the right, again the artistic,
material which limns the personality of the character and
reveals it to us through that unconscious tell-tale, the
character himself; whose story-people talk in just the
tone that makes even the impossible carry conviction; and
who last, or perhaps first, has a story to tell and an unhackneyed
way of telling it.</p>

<p>“Suggestion and restraint in a story appeal to me
most strongly.... And when in ‘the joy of working’
one masters the writer’s art, genius as well as mere talent,
the reaction will come; the audience will laugh or cry—or
both, if the gods are kind.”—<i>Frances Gilchrist Wood.</i>
